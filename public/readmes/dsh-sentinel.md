# dsh-sentinel

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Condition-driven wakeup for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): the agent registers a watch, goes to sleep — even closes the session — and the sentinel wakes it when the condition happens. Every subscription and every fire is a user-visible session event, and the browser dock shows what is on duty.

## How it works

The node half owns one server-lifetime runtime that folds a plugin-owned sidecar log (`$DSH_HOME/sentinel.jsonl`) into live subscriptions, probes every sensor on a shared 5s heartbeat, and delivers wakeups through the official followup channel — resuming a dormant session's agent first when needed. Subscriptions therefore survive process restarts, and conditions that become true while the server is down late-fire on the next probe.

Watching is a resident-process concern: probing and fire delivery only run while a long-running dsh process (typically `dsh web`) is up. Headless one-shot runs load the plugin and can create, list and cancel watches, but nothing probes after the process exits — those watches become active once a resident process starts.

One duty owner per `$DSH_HOME`: a lease file (`sentinel.lease`) makes the first process own probing and delivery; a second dsh process on the same home stays passive (tools work, writes persist to the shared sidecar) and takes over within one lease TTL of the owner dying. The owner re-reads the sidecar every heartbeat, so watches created on a passive instance are adopted automatically. Delivery is at-least-once: a fire logged but not delivered before a crash is requeued on the next boot from its `delivered` watermark.

The browser half is a dock card above the composer (the `conversation.input.dock` family) listing the session's active watches — sensor, target, live probe state, fire budget, next-probe countdown — plus recent fire history when expanded. It polls the read-only state route and renders nothing when the session has no watches.

Two surfaces make the server-global watch set visible. A sidebar branch grows under every session row that has active watches (`sidebar.workspaces.sessionRow.branch`, one shared poller for all rows) — collapsed it is a `👁` count, expanded it lists the session's watches and links to the dashboard. The dashboard is a standalone table of every watch across every session: session (active/dormant), sensor, target, pattern, fire budget, last probe state, next probe.

## Sensors

| Kind | Engine | Fires on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | path snapshot + inotify push | snapshot change (sub-second); accelerated by fs events |
| `command` | read-only shell line, probed on an interval | output/exit-code change |
| `http` | URL probed on an interval | status/body change |
| `process` | `pgrep -f` pattern, probed on an interval | match-set change |
| `port` | TCP connect to `[host:]port`, probed on an interval | reachability change (open/closed/timeout) |
| `webhook` | pure push | any POST to the returned hook URL |

With `pattern`, probe kinds fire on the no-match→match edge of that regex and webhooks accept only matching payloads; without it, probe kinds fire on any change after the baseline.

## Configuration

All deployment-tunable knobs live in the plugin's config schema (defaults in parentheses); override them on the bundle row in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: dsh-sentinel
  name: dsh-sentinel
  config:
    heartbeatMs: 5000            # probe round interval
    probeConcurrency: 8          # in-flight probes per round
    maxSubscriptionsPerSession: 16
    maxPendingWakeups: 8         # queued wakeups per session before dropping oldest
    defaultIntervalSeconds: 30   # when a watch does not specify one (5–86400)
    defaultCooldownSeconds: 60
    dutyLeaseTtlMs: 30000        # passive-instance takeover window after the owner dies
    notifyWebhookUrl: ''         # optional: POST every fire here as JSON
```

Invalid values fail plugin load with a schema error rather than misbehaving at runtime.

`notifyWebhookUrl` fans every fire out of the harness as a JSON POST (`{plugin, event, sessionId, id, kind, target, note, fireNumber, maxFires, summary, after}`) — point it at a Lark/WeCom/Slack bot or any receiver. Delivery is at-most-once: a failed POST warns in the log and never blocks the in-harness wakeup.

## Tools

- `sentinel_watch` — register a watch: `kind`, `target`, optional `pattern`, `interval` (1–3600s, default 30), `note` (delivered verbatim with every wakeup), `maxFires` (default 1: one-shot), `cooldown` (default 60s), optional `ttl`.
- `sentinel_list` — active watches with live probe state.
- `sentinel_cancel` — cancel one watch by id.

## Routes

- `GET /plugins/dsh-sentinel/state?sessionId=…` — read-only state for the dock and the sidebar branch (omit `sessionId` for every session).
- `GET /plugins/dsh-sentinel/dashboard` — the server-global watch table.
- `POST /plugins/dsh-sentinel/hook?id=watch-N&s=<sessionId>` — webhook entry; put a `curl` into a CI job, git hook, or another machine's script to wake the agent. Watch ids are per session, so the `s` qualifier is what keeps two sessions' `watch-1` hooks from colliding (the tool hands out the full URL). URLs without `s` still work and resolve to the first matching webhook watch.
- `POST /plugins/dsh-sentinel/cancel?sessionId=…&id=watch-N` — manual cancel. The dashboard table and every UI row carry a ✕ that calls this, so a watch can always be stopped by hand — including orphaned ones whose session (and agent) is long gone; the host has no session-deleted event, so this is the kill switch of last resort.
- All four routes enforce a browser-trust fence: browser-marked cross-site requests (a malicious page can form-POST to localhost) and DNS-rebinding attempts (Host/Origin naming a DNS host) get 403. Headerless clients such as `curl` and CI jobs are unaffected. The state route also reports `duty` (lease heartbeat age) and `droppedWakeups` per session (queued wakeups dropped by the `maxPendingWakeups` cap).

First-probe semantics: a pattern-less watch absorbs its first observation as the baseline (no fire), while a pattern watch whose target already matches fires on the first probe — the condition already holds.

## Compatibility

Verified against these harness versions (plugin loads, duty lease is held, web routes answer):

- `0.1.1-rc.2` — 2026-08-26, source-build smoke: git install into a web profile, duty lease held, state and dashboard routes answer
- `0.1.0-rc.8` — 2026-08-20, scratch-profile smoke
- `0.1.0-rc.7` — 2026-08-20, live web deployment

dsh-sentinel has no runtime dependency on `@deepseek-ai/*` packages. Compatibility here means the cordis loader entries, the `ctx.agents.resume()` followup channel, and the web routes keep working; file an issue if a harness version breaks any of them.

## Install


One line through the official bundle channel:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-sentinel
```

Or straight from git (build artifacts are committed, so the git-source install runs no build):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:fuhefei/dsh-sentinel#v0.11.0"
```

Alternatively, add the node half manually through a patch-list configuration over the shipped base:

```yaml
# cordis.patch.yml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-sentinel
      name: dsh-sentinel
```

The browser half ships in the same package (`./client`) and is injected by the Web UI's plugin loader.

### Sidebar branch prerequisite

The dock and the dashboard work on a stock host. The sidebar branch needs the session-row extension holes, which the official tree does not declare yet; apply the bundled patch to your DSH source checkout and rebuild `ui-workspace`:

```sh
git apply /path/to/dsh-sentinel/patches/session-row-holes.patch
```

The patch declares `sidebar.workspaces.sessionRow` and `sidebar.workspaces.sessionRow.branch` as **list** holes (every registrant renders, in order) at **root** scope (sidebar rows render outside any session binding; the row passes its `sessionId` through owner props). [dsh-subagent-tree](https://github.com/dsh-external/dsh-subagent-tree) ships a patch for the same hole names with different semantics (keyed/session); apply one or the other, not both.

### better-sidebar integration (optional)

When [dsh-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar) is installed in the same profile, sentinel registers its global watch table as a sidebar tab (`dsh-sentinel:watches`, in the **+** menu) through better-sidebar's documented `ctx.betterSidebar.registerTab` extension surface: every watch server-wide with live probe state, fire budgets and recent fire history, fed by one shared poller. No configuration needed; without better-sidebar the registration is silently skipped and the dock / branch / dashboard keep working as before.

### Plays well with

Install [dsh-notification](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-notification) alongside sentinel and the whole wakeup loop reaches your desktop: sentinel wakes the agent, the agent works the turn, and the turn's completion fires a desktop notification — no integration needed, the two plugins compose on their own.
