`dsh-auxiliary` is a [DeepSeek Harness](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/) plugin that layers auxiliary-model capabilities on the harness LLM seam (`ctx.llm`). It never replaces the main conversation model: each feature is an independent, optional route that kicks in only for its own narrow call category, so you can give expensive or specialized work (vision, compaction summaries, approval reviews, delegated subagents, session titles, image generation) its own cheap or capable model.

## Feature overview

| Feature | What it does | Where to configure |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vision understanding | `inspect_image` tool: read a local image and ask a vision model about it | Models page → Auxiliary Models → **Vision understanding** |
| Image handoff | Chat images survive a text-only main model via `describe_image` | Vision understanding card → **Image handoff** |
| Context compaction | Summaries (`purpose: 'compaction'`) use a dedicated model | Auxiliary Models → **Context compaction** |
| Compression engine *(optional)* | Replaces the compaction backend with an explicit compression prompt | `engine.enabled` in the config |
| Approval model | Reviews from @dsh-plugin/dsh-approve-for-me use a dedicated model | Auxiliary Models → **Approval model** |
| Subagent model | Delegated child agents use a dedicated model | Auxiliary Models → **Subagent model** |
| Title model | Session titles (`purpose: 'session-title'`) use a dedicated model | Auxiliary Models → **Title model** |
| Image-generation model | `generate_image` tool: create images through an OpenAI-compatible images API | Auxiliary Models → **Image-generation model** |
| Model capability marks | Checkboxes on your own `llm-pi-ai` models: **Allow image input** / **Allow image generation** | Models page → provider → customized settings → model |

All routes are configured in **Settings → Auxiliary Models** (the plugin ships that settings section) and take effect immediately on save — no restart, no rebuild of the conversation.

## Installation

Copy the block below and paste it to your DSH agent (the assistant in this web
GUI). The agent performs the install and verification for you — no manual npm
or profile editing needed:

```text
Install the @dsh-plugin/dsh-auxiliary plugin into the profile I specify (or ask me if I didn't name one). The npm package name is `@dsh-plugin/dsh-auxiliary`; use the GitHub source `github:dsh-plugins/dsh-auxiliary`, or `file:<path>` for local development.

Steps:
1. Add the plugin dependency: `dsh plugin --profile <PROFILE> add @dsh-plugin/dsh-auxiliary` (or the equivalent plugin-manager command for my profile). Since 0.4.1 the package is a bundle plugin (declares `dsh.bundle.patch`), so `dsh plugin add` also appends it to `dsh.profile.bundles` automatically — no manual `cordis.patch.yml` insert needed.
2. The package declares a `prepack` build script. If pnpm fails with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, approve the build in the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`allowBuilds`) and retry the add.
3. If this profile previously loaded the plugin through a manual insert row in `cordis.patch.yml` (pre-0.4.1 style), REMOVE that row — the bundle layer now mounts the plugin, and keeping both would mount it twice.
4. Verify `node_modules/@dsh-plugin/dsh-auxiliary` holds a built `lib/` directory (at least `lib/index.js` and `lib/client.js`). If the build artifacts are missing, run `npm run build` in the plugin directory and re-add.
5. Do not start the profile — install and verify only, then report what you changed.
```

Then open **Settings → Auxiliary Models** in the web UI to configure the
routes, and mark the models you want to use in **Settings → Models**.

## Features in detail

### Vision understanding and `inspect_image`

Configure a provider/model in the **Models** page first, then pick the pair under **Vision understanding** (saved as `vision.provider` + `vision.model`). `tool.enabled` independently controls whether the `inspect_image` tool is registered.

```yaml
vision:
  provider: anvilcraft-ai     # any registered provider route
  model: mimo-v2.5            # a vision-capable model on that provider
tool:
  enabled: true               # register the inspect_image tool
  maxImageBytes: 10485760     # per-file size cap
  timeoutMs: 120000           # cooperative tool-call budget
```

Once enabled, ask the agent to run `inspect_image` on a Host-readable path:

> Use inspect_image to analyze screenshots/error.png

The tool commits the file through the `ctx.attachments` seam and asks the selected vision model, returning a text answer (optionally truncated at `vision.maxTokens`). PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF are supported.

**Model capability mark**: for a user-configured `llm-pi-ai` model, the **Allow image input** checkbox in the model's settings writes its canonical `input` declaration (`[text, image]` when checked, `[text]` when cleared). Both `inspect_image` and the main chat composer read that same capability fact. The declaration cannot add vision to a text-only model — only check it when the upstream endpoint actually accepts images.

### Image handoff (chat images with a text-only main model)

When **Image handoff** (`vision.handoff`, default on) is enabled with a vision route selected, attaching an image to a text-only main model no longer fails:

1. A runtime wrapper on `ctx.llm.resolveModelInfo` claims image input for models that declare none while the handoff is active, so the image admission preflight passes (the model catalog and the per-model checkboxes are unaffected — they read the settings document directly).
2. A listener on the official `llm/stream` waterfall replaces the image block with a text reference `[image: {"attachmentId":…,"mediaType":…}]` before the adapter sees it; the text-only model never receives an image payload (vision-route calls such as `inspect_image` are left untouched).
3. The system prompt tells the main model to call `describe_image` with the exact JSON from the reference; the tool reads the stored attachment bytes, asks the selected vision model, and returns a text description.

The reference is plain text, so it survives restarts, forks, and replays. Both seams are plugin-side; no core package is modified. Disable `vision.handoff` to restore the original rejection behavior.

### Context compaction

Every summarization call carries the official `GenerateOptions.purpose: 'compaction'`. The plugin installs an `llm/stream` waterfall listener that reroutes those calls to the configured pair:

```yaml
compact:
  enabled: true
  provider: deepseek-official  # e.g. a cheap, fast summarizer
  model: deepseek-chat
```

The listener is always installed and is a pure pass-through until a complete route is configured. Only `purpose: 'compaction'` calls are rerouted; the main session and every other call category are untouched.

**Compression engine** *(optional)*: `engine.enabled: true` replaces the stock compaction backend with a `BasicCompactionEngine` subclass that drives summarization with an explicit context-compression instruction (see `engine.compressPrompt`). It reuses the compact route and adds no third model route. It is mutually exclusive with `@deepseek-ai/dsh-compaction-basic` — the plugin detects the conflict and skips the engine with a warning.

**Compaction threshold**: the Context compaction card exposes a slider plus a precise percentage input (17%–99%). Saving the threshold also enables the compression engine and writes `engine.thresholdRatio`, so compaction fires automatically once context usage reaches that percentage; the threshold must stay above the retention ratio (`engine.retainRatio`, 16% by default). The engine refreshes the policy before every pressure check, so no restart is needed after saving.

### Approval model (@dsh-plugin/dsh-approve-for-me hookup)

[@dsh-plugin/dsh-approve-for-me](https://github.com/dsh-plugins/dsh-approve-for-me) adds codex-style auto-approval; in `review` mode a lightweight reviewer model decides each approval prompt. The **Approval model** card gives the review a dedicated model:

```yaml
approve:
  enabled: true
  provider: anvilcraft-ai
  model: mimo-v2.5
```

1. A listener on the `llm/stream` waterfall recognizes the review call by its public contract — the fixed `>>> APPROVAL REQUEST START` marker in the user message, no `sessionId`, and `temperature: 0` — and reroutes it to `approve.provider` / `approve.model`.
2. Everything else about the call (policy, transcript, timeout, retries, fallback) stays owned by approve-for-me; only the model route is swapped, and the verdict never enters the session history.

The routing activates only when enabled with a complete route; without the plugin installed there are no review calls, so the listener is inert. Requires approve-for-me's `mode: review` plus the `approve-for-me` or `strict-review` permission preset. Prefer a cheap, fast model.

The settings page detects installation: the plugin serves a read-only JSON endpoint at `/dsh-auxiliary/state` (`{"approvePluginInstalled": true|false}`) through the optional `webServer` service, and the card shows a "plugin not installed" notice with editing disabled when the presets are absent from the live `permissionPresets` table. The endpoint is loopback-local, returns no sensitive data, and is absent on headless profiles.

### Subagent model

```yaml
subagent:
  enabled: true
  provider: anvilcraft-ai
  model: deepseek-chat
```

Child agents inherit their parent's route by default. With this feature enabled and a complete route, every delegated child — one-shot spawn/fork runs and continuable children, including cold-resumed ones — is routed to the selected pair. The plugin listens for `agent/created` and, for agents with delegation depth > 0, installs an `agent/request` waterfall listener on the agent's own scoped context; returning a replacement `LlmCallConfig` is the loop's official "switch" contract, so the changed header snapshot is logged like any other model switch. Remote providers (ACP) never register a process-local agent and their children keep inheriting the parent route. Prefer a cheap, fast model to control delegation cost. No external plugin required.

### Title model

```yaml
title:
  enabled: true
  provider: anvilcraft-ai
  model: deepseek-chat
```

Session titles are issued by the `dsh-session-title-llm` provider, which has its own deployment-level `provider`/`model` config. With this feature enabled, every `purpose: 'session-title'` call is rerouted to the selected pair, leaving the provider's own config and the main session route untouched. Recognition uses the official `GenerateOptions.purpose` marker, so it cannot collide with agent-loop, compaction, or approval calls. Like the compaction router, the listener is always installed and passes through until a complete route is configured.

### Image-generation model and `generate_image`

```yaml
imagegen:
  enabled: true
  provider: lanqin-gpt          # an OpenAI-compatible provider route
  model: gpt-image-2
```

The harness LLM seam only speaks text, so image generation talks to the provider's OpenAI-compatible **images API** directly. With this feature enabled and a complete route:

1. The `generate_image` tool is registered and a system-prompt section tells the main model to call it when the user asks to generate, draw, or create a picture.
2. The tool reads the provider's `baseURL` from the resolved `llm-pi-ai` settings and resolves `apiKeyEnv` through the harness **credential seam** (`ctx.credentials.resolve` — env/file/user-env layers), then calls `POST {baseURL}/images/generations` with `{model, prompt, size, n}`.
3. The returned images (base64 or URL) are written under the working directory (`.dsh/generated/`) and the file paths are returned; the main model can verify them with `inspect_image`.

**Model capability mark**: the picker only lists models marked **Allow image generation** — check that box in the model's settings (it writes `imageGeneration: true` into the raw user section of the `llm-pi-ai` namespace). Mark exactly the models whose upstream endpoint actually generates images.

## How it works

The plugin is built on standard DSH extension points (see the [plugin development guide](https://deepseek-harness.github.io/deepseek-harness/develop/basic/)). Nothing in the harness core is modified.

### 1. Purpose-keyed model routing

All text routing shares one pattern: install an `llm/stream` waterfall listener **once** (always active), inspect the call, and either pass it through untouched or re-enter the seam with a frozen replacement config:

- **Recognition** uses stable, official markers — `GenerateOptions.purpose` (`'compaction'` / `'session-title'`) or the approval call's public contract — so each router can only ever match its own call category.
- **Rerouting** calls `deepFreeze({...options, provider, model})` and re-enters `ctx.llm.stream()`; the `provider`/`model` replacement is the only change, so timeouts, retries, and fallback stay harness-owned.
- **Loop protection**: the replacement carries the same route marker; an equality check on the config prevents the router from matching its own re-entry.
- **Laziness**: the listener is a pure pass-through until a complete route exists — enabling the feature later needs no reinstall, and disabling it needs no cleanup beyond removing the listener.

### 2. Tools and system guidance

Tools are registered with `ctx.tools.register(defineTool(...))` and announced to the model through `ctx.systemPrompt.section(...)`:

- `inspect_image` — vision understanding: file path + optional question → attachment seam → vision route → text answer.
- `describe_image` — handoff: reads the JSON from a chat `[image: …]` reference and answers via the vision route.
- `generate_image` — image generation: prompt (+size/n) → provider images API (credential seam) → PNG files under `.dsh/generated/` → paths.

Each tool is registered only while its feature is enabled with a complete route (reconcile pattern), so the model never sees a tool it cannot use.

### 3. Settings integration and the model catalog

The plugin registers its own settings namespace (`dsh-auxiliary`) with a schemastery schema; the settings page writes through `settings.update(...)`, and `installSettingsSection` keeps the plugin's resolved view in sync. Two details matter:

- **Raw vs resolved**: model rows in the `llm-pi-ai` namespace are validated by a `z.object` schema that strips unknown keys from *resolved* views but does not throw — so non-schema fields like `imageGeneration` survive in the **raw user section**. Reads that must see such fields go through `namespace.user` (raw); routed reads use `settings.get()` (resolved).
- **DOM injection**: the model catalog page is owned by the harness client, so the plugin observes the DOM (`MutationObserver`) and appends the **Allow image input** / **Allow image generation** checkboxes into each user-owned model row's expanded advanced area. The checkboxes initialize from the raw user section; changes are held in the browser until that provider card closes (after the page's Apply) and are then written back to the raw user section, so they cannot race the page's own revision check. The image-generation picker filters the catalog to marked models only.

### 4. Credentials, not plain env

`apiKeyEnv` values are `credential-ref`s, so the image-generation tool resolves the key through `ctx.credentials.resolve(credentialRef(...))` — the harness credential seam covers env/file/user-env layers and re-resolves per call (a changed key reaches the next call without a restart). Never `process.env`.

### 5. Everything reconfigures live

Each feature is owned by a `reconcile*()` + disposer pair: on every settings change the plugin re-resolves the config and registers or disposes exactly the pieces whose conditions changed. Saving a route in the web UI takes effect immediately.

## Configuration

All fields are optional; defaults are shown.

```yaml
- name: '@dsh-plugin/dsh-auxiliary'
  config:
    vision:
      maxTokens: 2048                      # inspect_image output cap (provider/model written by the settings page)

      provider: ""                         # e.g. deepseek-official (a registered provider route id)

```

### Settings page: Auxiliary Models

![Auxiliary Models settings page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dsh-plugins/dsh-auxiliary/1f83918c2b2f2e6a8e46edab328e7b577277c189/docs/image.png)

The plugin ships a web settings section (**Settings → Auxiliary Models**).
Configure providers and models in the **Models** page first, then use the
feature cards here: each card has its own enable switch and provider/model
picker. The picker presents all currently available models together, grouped
by provider (the image-generation card lists only models marked **Allow image
generation**). A saved route that is temporarily absent from the catalog is
kept and is never replaced automatically.

### Marking models in the catalog

For a user-configured `llm-pi-ai` model, open its model settings under
**Settings → Models → Provider → Customized settings → Models → Model
settings**:

- **Allow image input** writes the canonical `input` declaration (`[text,
  image]` when checked, `[text]` when cleared) — consumed by `inspect_image`
  and the main chat composer. Enable only when the upstream endpoint actually
  accepts images.
- **Allow image generation** writes `imageGeneration: true` — the mark that
  makes the model selectable in the **Image-generation model** card. Enable
  only when the upstream endpoint actually generates images.

The checkboxes are injected into every user-owned `llm-pi-ai` model row, inside
the same capacity disclosure as the **Context window** and **Max output tokens**
fields, so they stay out of the way until that row fold is expanded. A model you
are **adding** inside the custom-provider create card gets working checkboxes
too; a row added without a model id shows both checkboxes disabled inside that
fold until an id is typed, and editing an existing model id carries its saved
capability marks to the new id. A changed mark is recorded in the browser first
and written after the page saves the provider settings (Apply), so you can edit
other model fields alongside image capabilities without tripping the page's own
"settings changed elsewhere" revision conflict. Rows that cannot carry the
marks explain why instead of staying silent: DeepSeek-official (or any
non-pi-ai adapter) rows show a notice that the marks are `llm-pi-ai`-only, and
pi-ai catalog rows not yet saved into the user section say to save the model
first.

The same fold also exposes **thinking-level** configuration: a list of rows
adds/removes levels (only `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`,
`max`), a pencil button batch-edits text such as `[low, high, max]` and rejects
the whole input when any entry is invalid, and the default-thinking dropdown
offers only the levels present in the list. New models start with an empty list
and no default. These read and write the OFFICIAL model `reasoningEfforts`
field (level → same-name wire token, `off` → `null`) and the provider-level
`reasoning` default — the very data pi-ai uses to decide whether a model is a
reasoning model and to render the composer's reasoning-effort picker, so this
editor is just an authoring surface for the official mechanism, with no
plugin-owned storage. Changes are still written only after the provider card
Apply closes, so they never race the page's revision checks.

> Previous versions stored the levels in plugin-owned fields (`thinkingLevels`
> / `defaultThinkingLevel`); the first save after upgrading migrates them to
> the official fields and drops the old ones.

## Notes

- Routing features reroute only their own call category (`purpose:
  'compaction'` / `purpose: 'session-title'` / the approval review contract);
  the main session route is never touched.
- `engine.enabled: true` **replaces** the stock compaction backend; do not load
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-compaction-basic` at the same time. The plugin detects the
  conflict and skips the engine with a warning.
- Vision tool arguments: `path` (absolute or workspace-relative) and optional
  `question`. Supported formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, GIF.
- `generate_image` arguments: `prompt` (required), optional `size` and `n`
  (most providers accept only `n: 1`).
