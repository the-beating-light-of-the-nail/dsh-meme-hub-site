## What it does

- Open a resizable xterm.js SSH terminal on the right of a session. When **DSH-better-sidebar** is also enabled, the terminal docks to the left of the sidebar instead of covering the file sidebar or the top-right controls.
- Manage any number of servers and groups under **Settings → Plugins → SSH Resources**; the top **SSH** toggle only shows or hides the right-side terminal.
- Server name, address, port, username, auth type, and group are stored in DSH local storage; there is no count limit.
- Passwords, PEM private keys, and passphrases are stored **only** in DSH's official local credentials store `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (owner-only permissions). Browser storage, agent context, tool results, and resource lists never read or display secrets.
- The main conversation auto-detects the currently-connected server on the right; the agent never has to ask the user for an internal connection id.
- Commands the agent runs via `ssh_exec` are echoed in the right-side terminal, and the exit code, output, duration, timeout, and truncation status are returned to the main conversation for analysis.
- Manual terminal output is read on demand via `ssh_read`; it is never silently injected into the conversation context.
- Output sent to the model is redacted for private keys, Bearer tokens, common passwords/API keys (including bare `sk-`-prefixed keys), and database passwords.
- **Connection stability**: SSH connections enable keepalive (20s interval, 3 checks), so NAT/firewalls no longer silently drop idle connections. Transport drops trigger exponential-backoff auto-reconnect (capped at 30s); a command that drops mid-run is retried once transparently. Transient connection failures auto-retry 3 times (auth failures excluded). Explicit disconnect or plugin unload never triggers reconnect; remote tunnels re-register automatically after a reconnect.
- **Host-key verification (TOFU)**: SSH connections verify the server's host public-key fingerprint — first connect records and trusts it, later changes are rejected (guards against MITM / re-provisioned servers). Per-server `hostKeyMode` selects `accept-new` (default) / `verify` (reject unseen) / `off`; on a changed fingerprint the connection is **not retried and not auto-reconnected**. Settings → SSH Resources lets you set the mode per server and manage trusted fingerprints with one-click forget. Verification runs before user authentication, so it is independent of who logs in or which password they use — the same server with an unchanged key never blocks another admin or vendor.
- **File management**: a Files tab in the SSH panel browses the server's filesystem over SFTP with upload, download, mkdir, delete, and rename. The `sftp_*` tools can also be used directly in the conversation.
- **Port forwarding**: a Tunnels tab starts local forwards (this machine → server-reachable target) and remote forwards (server → this machine), with a live tunnel list and stop control. The `tunnel_*` tools can also be used directly.
- **Databases**: a Database tab connects to MySQL / PostgreSQL / Redis / MongoDB, runs SQL queries or commands manually, and shows results in a table. The `db_*` tools can also be used directly.
  - `db_connect` auto-tunnels over SSH: once a server is connected, loopback hosts (127.0.0.1 / localhost / ::1) are automatically tunneled through the current server to reach intranet databases. `via_ssh` selects `auto` (default) / `yes` / `no`; an explicit `ssh_connection_id` takes precedence.
  - Three SSL modes (`disabled` plain / `preferred` encrypt-without-verify / `verify` encrypt+verify-CA) for cloud-managed databases.
  - Database connections can be saved as profiles for one-click reconnect after restart; passwords are encrypted in the DSH credentials store; saved resources support renaming and collapsible grouping.
  - High-risk SQL (`DROP DATABASE`/`SCHEMA`/`TABLE`, `TRUNCATE`, `SHUTDOWN`) is auto-blocked, detected by **statement verb** (skipping strings/comments, supporting multi-statement), so keywords inside string literals are never false-positives.
- **Multi-server fan-out**: `ssh_cluster` runs one command concurrently across all connected servers (or a filtered subset), returning exit code and output per connection.

## Security boundary

DSH's own permission mechanism remains in effect. This plugin additionally stops agent tools from executing clearly irreversible or destructive operations, such as deleting files, dropping databases, formatting disks, `terraform destroy`, `kubectl delete`, `docker prune`, forced Git cleanup, and reboot/shutdown.

When the agent hits the blocklist it is not silently refused: the plugin creates a one-shot **pending-confirmation** record and immediately pops a viewport-wide confirmation modal (full command, risk reason, and **Execute** / **Undo** buttons; Esc, clicking the backdrop, or "handle later in the panel" dismisses it temporarily — it closes automatically once every queued command is handled, and still-unhandled items pop up again when the panel reopens). Unhandled items also stay as cards above the SSH panel's terminal, collapsed to a one-line summary (command + host + always-visible Execute/Undo); the newest starts expanded, clicking expands the risk reason and full command. Only the operator's red **Execute** button submits the command (sending it to the server with Enter); **Undo** clears the record. The command is never pre-filled into the terminal — the input line stays empty, so the operator cannot accidentally run a blocked command by pressing Enter. Multiple dangerous commands queue independently as separate cards. If no live terminal session exists, or the command contains control characters like Tab that cannot be safely sent to a PTY, it degrades to a copyable command card returned in the conversation for the operator to paste into the terminal. Ordinary ops (configure SSL, install packages, edit configs, reload services) flow through DSH's normal permission process.

The same model covers `sftp_delete` (the agent no longer deletes directly; instead the equivalent `rm -rf <path>` is queued for confirmation) and `db_execute` high-risk SQL (`DROP`/`TRUNCATE`/`SHUTDOWN`): high-risk SQL keeps the same pattern, returning a card with a ```sql code block for the operator to paste into the database panel's SQL editor and run manually. SQL detection works by **statement verb** (skipping strings/comments, splitting on `;` for multi-statement), so keywords inside string literals are never false-positives, and high-frequency CRUD passes through normally.

## Installation

### From GitHub (recommended)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:caoyiwei850/dsh-ssh-ops#v0.2.13
```

Then restart DSH Web:

```bash
dsh web
```

Open any session, click the top **SSH** tab, and use the right-side panel to connect to a server.

### From a release archive

Download `dsh-ssh-ops-0.2.13.tgz` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/caoyiwei850/dsh-ssh-ops/releases/tag/v0.2.13), then:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-ssh-ops-0.2.13.tgz
dsh web
```

`dsh-ssh-ops-0.2.13.zip` is for offline review or further development; extract it and run `npm install && npm run build` in the directory.

## Usage

1. Open **Settings → Plugins → SSH Resources** and create a group or server resource; PEM / `.key` files can be imported directly.
2. A saved resource can be "connect & open" to auto-create a right-side PTY terminal. When editing, leaving a secret field blank keeps the existing value; clearing credentials requires explicit confirmation.
3. The top **SSH** only toggles the right-side terminal; the `+` in the top-right picks a saved resource or creates a non-persistent temporary connection.
4. In the main conversation, just say "check server memory usage" or "configure the Nginx SSL certificate". The agent can only operate the active connection; it cannot enumerate saved resources, read credentials, or auto-connect using saved credentials.
5. For databases, have the agent call `db_connect` (or create a connection yourself in the Database tab), then query/execute from the conversation.

### Agent tools

There are 24 tools. Omitting `connection_id` / `db_connection_id` targets the active connection — **no need to call `ssh_list` / `db_list_connections` first**.

#### SSH (7)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ssh_list` | List open SSH connections and identify the active server; only when the user asks which is connected |
| `ssh_connect` | Connect over SSH (password or private key) and make it the current server |
| `ssh_exec` | Run a command on the current server; returns exit code/output/duration/timeout/truncation/redacted state |
| `ssh_read` | Read buffered output from the right-side terminal on demand (never silently injected) |
| `ssh_write` | Send interactive input to the current terminal (e.g. `y\n` to answer a prompt) |
| `ssh_disconnect` | Close the current connection and its shell sessions |
| `ssh_cluster` | Run one command concurrently across all open connections (or a filtered subset); **only when the user explicitly asks for multi-server execution** |

#### SFTP (6)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `sftp_list` | List remote directory entries (with size/mtime/mode) |
| `sftp_read` | Read a remote file's contents (default cap 4 MiB) |
| `sftp_write` | Write text to a remote file (create or overwrite) |
| `sftp_mkdir` | Create a remote directory |
| `sftp_delete` | Delete a remote file or empty dir (**not executed directly**; queues `rm -rf <path>` for confirmation or returns a copyable card) |
| `sftp_rename` | Rename or move a remote path |

#### Port forwarding (3)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `tunnel_start` | Start a local forward (`local`, this machine → server-reachable target) or a remote forward (`remote`, server → this machine) |
| `tunnel_list` | List active tunnels |
| `tunnel_stop` | Stop a tunnel by `tunnel_id` |

#### Database (8)

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `db_connect` | Connect to MySQL / PostgreSQL / Redis / MongoDB; loopback hosts auto-tunnel through the current SSH server; three SSL modes |
| `db_list_connections` | List open database connections (only when the user asks) |
| `db_query` | Run a read-only SELECT on MySQL/PostgreSQL (capped at 200 rows; supports `?` / `$1` placeholders) |
| `db_execute` | Run a write statement (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/CREATE/ALTER); high-risk SQL (DROP/TRUNCATE/SHUTDOWN) is not executed, returns a copyable card |
| `db_list_tables` | List tables in the current schema of MySQL/PostgreSQL |
| `db_describe_table` | Describe a table's columns (name/type/nullable/default) |
| `db_run` | Run a command on Redis (`command`+`args`), or `find`/`findOne`/`insertOne`/`updateOne`/`deleteOne`/`countDocuments` on MongoDB |
| `db_disconnect` | Close a database connection |

> Use `db_query` for read-only SQL, `db_execute` for SQL writes, and `db_run` for Redis/MongoDB. MySQL uses `?` placeholders; PostgreSQL uses `$1` placeholders.
