# dsh-hooks

Config-driven lifecycle hooks plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh).

Declare `event -> command` hooks directly in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml` — like Codex CLI / OpenCode hooks, but for dsh. No plugin code required.

[中文文档](README.zh.md) | [Design](#design) | [Feishu example](examples/notify-feishu.mjs) | [Web GUI](#web-gui)

## Install

One package ships everything (hook engine + Web GUI settings page):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-hooks           # from npm
# or straight from git:
dsh plugin --profile web add github:PeterBon/dsh-hooks
```

Restart `dsh web`. The settings panel gains a "Hooks" section (see [Web GUI](#web-gui)).

## Configure

Add a config block to your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: dsh-hooks
  name: dsh-hooks
  config:
    hooks:
      - on: 'turn/end'
        when: 'completed'            # optional: only completed turns
        run: 'node examples/notify-feishu.mjs'
        timeoutMs: 10000             # optional, default 10000
      - on: 'approval/asked'
        run: 'powershell -Command "Write-Output approval-requested >> hooks.log"'
      - on: 'tool/call'
        match:                       # optional: field → regex, all must match
          tool: '^(rm|git|ssh)'
        run: 'node examples/notify-webhook.mjs --slack'
      - on: 'turn/end'
        when: 'completed'
        run: 'node examples/notify-feishu.mjs'
        retries: 2                   # optional: retry non-zero exits (default 0)
        retryDelayMs: 1000           # optional: base retry delay, doubles (default 500)
      - on: 'turn/end'
        input: 'stdin'               # optional: write the full context JSON to stdin
        run: 'node my-hook.mjs'
      - on: 'approval/asked'
        notify:                      # built-in notification: instead of run, no script needed
          channel: 'desktop'         # platform balloon/toast
      - on: 'turn/end'
        when: 'completed'
        notify:
          channel: 'webhook'         # POST JSON to any HTTP endpoint
          url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/…'
          slack: true                # optional: { text } one-line summary (Slack style)
      - on: 'step/end'
        run: 'node examples/log-step.mjs'
        debounceMs: 500              # optional: debounce high-frequency events
        maxConcurrent: 2             # optional: cap concurrent processes
      - on: 'tool/result'
        match:
          toolDurationMs: '>10000'   # numeric comparison ({ gt: 10000 } object form too)
        run: 'node examples/notify-slow-tool.mjs'
      - on: 'turn/end'
        enabled: false               # optional: disable without deleting
        cwd: 'session'               # optional: run in the session working directory
        run: 'node examples/log-turn.mjs'
```

Every hook field:

| Field | Meaning | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `on` | triggering event (see the event table) | required |
| `when` | filter `turn/end` by end reason | all reasons |
| `match` | field → regex or numeric comparison, all must match; fields are context keys (`tool` / `sessionName` / `sessionId` / `error` / `source` / `cwd` / `content` / `reason` / `turn` / `durationMs` / `toolDurationMs`, …), a field absent from the context never matches. Regexes test the string form; comparisons (`{ gt: 10000 }` or `'>10000'`, ops `gt` / `gte` / `lt` / `lte` / `eq`, combinable) apply only to numeric fields and never match non-numeric ones | no filter |
| `run` | command spawned through the platform shell (exactly one of `run` / `notify`) | one of the two required |
| `notify` | built-in notification (exactly one of `run` / `notify`): `channel: webhook` (HTTP JSON; omit `url` to use `DSH_HOOKS_WEBHOOK_URL`, `slack: true` for a one-line summary) or `channel: desktop` (platform balloon/toast) | one of the two required |
| `input` | `env` passes only the `DSH_HOOK_*` variables; `stdin` additionally writes the full context JSON to the command's stdin | `env` |
| `timeoutMs` | per-run timeout (ms); the process tree is terminated on expiry | 10000 |
| `retries` | retry count for non-zero exit codes (spawn failures and timeouts never retry) | 0 |
| `retryDelayMs` | base delay between retries (ms), doubles per attempt | 500 |
| `enabled` | `false` disables the hook without deleting it: the declaration stays, dispatch skips it silently (never counts as a failure) | `true` |
| `cwd` | working directory for the spawned command: `session` runs in the session's cwd, an absolute path runs there (`run` only) | plugin process directory |
| `maxConcurrent` | max concurrently running processes for this hook; triggers beyond the cap are dropped (recorded as `skipped`) | unlimited |
| `debounceMs` | debounce window (ms): triggers of high-frequency events (`step/end`, `tool/*`, …) inside the window collapse into one trailing execution carrying the latest context | 0 (off) |

## Events (v1)

| Event | When it fires | Useful context |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `turn/start` | A turn begins (with `turn/start` hooks, dispatch waits for the turn's first direct user message and attaches its text as `DSH_HOOK_CONTENT`; turns without one dispatch content-less at `turn/end`, see below) | session id, turn, initiating message text |
| `turn/end` | A turn ends (`completed` / `error` / `aborted` / `blocked` / `max-tokens` / `interrupted`) | reason, turn, duration, content, turn token usage, running subagents |
| `tree/settled` | A watched session's whole subagent tree settles (no live child still running) after a turn ended with work handed off | total subagents, handoff→settle duration |
| `step/end` | One step of a turn ends (one model call plus its tool executions) | turn, step |
| `tool/call` | The model requests one tool invocation | tool name, call id, raw arguments JSON |
| `tool/result` | A tool call completes | tool name (resolved), result text, failure identity, wall-clock duration (absent when the pairing call was never seen) |
| `user/message` | A user-role message appears on the surface | source kind (`user` / `plugin` / …), message text |
| `approval/asked` | A tool call requests user approval | tool name, call id, approval id, reason |
| `approval/decided` | A pending approval gets its outcome (paired with `approval/asked` by id) | outcome, tool name (resolved), call id, approval id |
| `session/title` | The session title updates (explicit rename / LLM title / fallback) | new title, source kind |
| `session/created` | A session is published | session id, cwd |
| `session/disposed` | A session leaves the registry | session id, cwd |
| `agent/created` | An agent is published | session id |
| `agent/disposed` | An agent leaves the registry | session id |
| `agent/error` | The agent loop reports an error | error text |
| `agent/status` | Agent status transition | status |
| `hook/failed` | A hook fails consecutively past `failedAlertThreshold` (default 3; synthetic, emitted from the outcome stream) | failing hook summary, consecutive failure count |

The `when` filter for `turn/end` matches the `reason.kind` value (`completed`, `error`, …). Hooks for other events run unconditionally.

## Command execution

- Each matching hook spawns `run` through the platform shell, **fire-and-forget**: failures only `console.warn`, never retried by default (`retries` opts into background retries of non-zero exits), never block the agent loop. Command stdout/stderr is captured (64 KiB per stream); on a non-zero exit the stderr tail is appended to the warning log.
- Context is passed via **environment variables** (no shell injection through data):

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `DSH_HOOK_EVENT` | event type, e.g. `turn/end` |
| `DSH_HOOK_SESSION_ID` | session id |
| `DSH_HOOK_SESSION_NAME` | readable session title (latest `session/title` log event, or first human prompt) |
| `DSH_HOOK_CWD` | session working directory |
| `DSH_HOOK_TURN` | turn number (turn / step / tool events) |
| `DSH_HOOK_STEP` | step number (step / tool events) |
| `DSH_HOOK_REASON` | turn end reason kind |
| `DSH_HOOK_TOOL` | tool name (approval / tool events) |
| `DSH_HOOK_CALL_ID` | tool call id (approval / tool events) |
| `DSH_HOOK_TOOL_ARGS` | raw tool arguments JSON (tool/call) |
| `DSH_HOOK_TOOL_ERROR` | tool failure identity `name: code` (tool/result errors) |
| `DSH_HOOK_TOOL_DURATION_MS` | wall-clock tool execution ms (tool/result; absent when the pairing tool/call was never seen) |
| `DSH_HOOK_SOURCE` | message / title source kind (`user`, `plugin`, `fallback`, `provider`, …) |
| `DSH_HOOK_DURATION_MS` | turn duration ms (turn/end) |
| `DSH_HOOK_STATUS` | agent status (`agent/status`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_ERROR` | error text (`agent/error`, and the failure message on `turn/end` error) |
| `DSH_HOOK_CONTENT` | event content snapshot: turn assistant text, tool result text, user message text, turn-initiating message text (turn/start) |
| `DSH_HOOK_USAGE_INPUT_TOKENS` | aggregated input tokens of the turn (turn/end, summed across steps) |
| `DSH_HOOK_USAGE_OUTPUT_TOKENS` | aggregated output tokens of the turn |
| `DSH_HOOK_USAGE_CACHE_READ_TOKENS` | aggregated cache-read tokens, when reported |
| `DSH_HOOK_USAGE_CACHE_WRITE_TOKENS` | aggregated cache-write tokens, when reported |
| `DSH_HOOK_USAGE_REASONING_TOKENS` | aggregated reasoning tokens, when reported |
| `DSH_HOOK_RUNNING_SUBAGENTS` | live subagents still running under this session (turn/end; `0` = none — lets a hook tell "work handed off to background subagents" apart from "the turn finished for real") |
| `DSH_HOOK_PARENT_SESSION_ID` | parent session id (subagent lineage; absent for top-level sessions) |
| `DSH_HOOK_SUBAGENT` | `1` when the session is a subagent child, `0` otherwise |
| `DSH_HOOK_DELEGATION_DEPTH` | delegation depth from the session header (`0` = top-level session) |
| `DSH_HOOK_SESSION_CREATED_AT` | session creation time, epoch ms |
| `DSH_HOOK_AGENT_PRESET` | agent preset id composing the session's agent, when known |
| `DSH_HOOK_APPROVAL_ID` | approval audit id (`approval/asked` + `approval/decided`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_APPROVAL_OUTCOME` | approval decision outcome (`approval/decided`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_TOTAL_SUBAGENTS` | total subagents in the settled tree (`tree/settled`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_TREE_DURATION_MS` | parent turn/end → tree settle duration, ms (`tree/settled`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_FAILED_HOOK` | identity summary of the hook that failed consecutively (`hook/failed`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_FAILURES` | consecutive failure count when the alert fired (`hook/failed`) |
| `DSH_HOOK_TIMESTAMP` | ISO timestamp |

- `{{var}}` placeholders inside `run` are substituted from the same context, e.g. `run: 'echo {{DSH_HOOK_SESSION_ID}} >> log.txt'`.
- Failure alerts: fire-and-forget hooks fail silently by design, so the plugin also watches the outcome stream. When one hook fails `failedAlertThreshold` consecutive times (`spawn-failed` / `exit-nonzero` / `timeout` / `send-failed`; one logical run's final outcome counts once, internal retries don't add extra counts), the synthetic `hook/failed` event fires once per streak — a success resets both the counter and the dedup. Alert with a normal hook:

```yaml
config:
  failedAlertThreshold: 3   # optional, default 3
  hooks:
    - on: 'hook/failed'
      notify: { channel: 'desktop' }
    - on: 'turn/end'
      run: 'node my-hook.mjs'
```
- `turn/end` hooks are dispatched after the running-subagent count resolves, i.e. one async hop later than other events — an immediately following event from the same session (e.g. the next `turn/start`) may dispatch first.

A common use for `DSH_HOOK_RUNNING_SUBAGENTS` is suppressing the end-of-turn notification while background subagents are still working and only notifying once a turn settles with nothing left running. Note the parent session emits `turn/end` exactly once (with the count > 0); the "everything settled" signal arrives as `turn/end` on the last child session, whose count is `0`:

```yaml
- on: 'turn/end'
  match: { runningSubagents: '^0$' }  # anchor the regex: bare '0' also matches '10'
  run: 'node examples/notify-webhook.mjs'
```

For the simpler "notify only once the whole tree settles" pattern, the synthetic `tree/settled` event does the watching for you — the plugin tracks sessions whose turn ended with running subagents and fires `tree/settled` on that session when the tree reaches zero:

```yaml
- on: 'tree/settled'
  notify: { channel: 'webhook', url: 'https://hooks.slack.com/services/…' }
```

Settled-but-idle continuable children do not count as running, so they don't keep suppressing the notification. The settle watch is event-driven and best-effort: it survives until the plugin restarts, and a failed re-check drops the watch silently (no late notification).

### Numeric match comparisons

Numeric context fields (`turn`, `step`, `durationMs`, `toolDurationMs`, `usage*`, `runningSubagents`, …) support real comparisons instead of regex hacks:

```yaml
- on: 'tool/result'
  match: { toolDurationMs: '>10000' }   # string syntax: > >= < <= =
  run: 'node examples/notify-slow-tool.mjs'

- on: 'tool/result'
  match:
    toolDurationMs: { gt: 10000, lt: 60000 }   # object syntax: gt/gte/lt/lte/eq, combinable
  run: 'node examples/notify-slow-tool.mjs'
```

Rules:

- Comparison semantics apply only to **numeric** fields; on a string field a comparison **never matches** (no string coercion).
- A string value counts as a comparison only when it starts with `>` / `>=` / `<` / `<=` / `=` followed by a number (e.g. `'>10000'`); anything else stays a plain regex.
- A missing field still never matches. An empty object `{}` matches vacuously.

### Execution options: enabled / cwd / maxConcurrent / debounceMs

Every hook can tune its execution independently:

- **`enabled: false`** disables the hook but keeps the declaration. Skipping is silent — no history record, never part of a failure streak (`hook/failed` never fires for a disabled hook). dry-run marks it `enabled: false（已停用）`.
- **`cwd: 'session'`** spawns `run` in the session's working directory (the project the agent works on), so hook scripts can read/write project files directly; an absolute path works too. Defaults to the plugin process directory.
- **`maxConcurrent`** caps concurrent processes for the hook. Triggers beyond the cap are dropped and recorded as `skipped` (no failure alert); one logical run (its internal retries included) always occupies one slot.
- **`debounceMs`** debounces high-frequency events (`step/end`, `tool/*`, …): triggers inside the window collapse into one **trailing** execution carrying the latest context. Collapsed triggers are fully silent — they never flood the log or history. New triggers after the window run normally.

The recommended combination against `step/end` / `tool/*` spawn storms:

```yaml
- on: 'step/end'
  run: 'node examples/log-step.mjs'
  debounceMs: 500       # consecutive step ends within half a second run once
  maxConcurrent: 2      # safety net: at most 2 processes even when slow
```

### turn/start carries the initiating message

The session log records `turn/start` *before* the turn's `user/message`, so the prompt text is not readable at turn-start time. When `turn/start` hooks exist, the plugin defers their dispatch until the turn's first direct user message is classified, attaching its text as `DSH_HOOK_CONTENT` (capped at 2000 chars):

```yaml
- on: 'turn/start'
  match: { content: 'deploy|release' }   # only turns asking about deploys
  notify: { channel: 'desktop' }
```

Timing notes:

- The deferral only kicks in when `turn/start` hooks exist; otherwise dispatch stays as before (immediate, no content).
- Only direct user messages (`source.kind === 'user'`) complete the dispatch; synthetic injections (agent/plugin sources) do not.
- A turn without a direct user message (e.g. a goal continuation round) dispatches `turn/start` **without content** at `turn/end`; a new turn flushes an unclaimed previous `turn/start` first.
- For direct-user turns the delay is typically milliseconds (`user/message` immediately follows `turn/start`), still ahead of any step/tool events.

## Generic webhook example

Besides Feishu, `examples/notify-webhook.mjs` posts the full hook context as one JSON document to any HTTP endpoint — Slack incoming webhooks, Discord, Lark/DingTalk custom bots, ntfy, Bark, n8n:

```yaml
- id: dsh-hooks
  name: dsh-hooks
  config:
    hooks:
      - on: 'turn/end'
        when: 'completed'
        run: 'node examples/notify-webhook.mjs --url https://hooks.slack.com/services/…'
      - on: 'tool/result'        # alert on tool failures
        run: 'node examples/notify-webhook.mjs --slack'
```

The URL may also live in the dsh process environment as `DSH_HOOKS_WEBHOOK_URL` (never in config files). `--slack` swaps the payload for a one-line `{ text }` summary; `--timeout <ms>` sets the fetch timeout (default 10000, one automatic retry on transport failure).

## Execution history

Every hook trigger is recorded into an in-memory ring buffer (default 500 entries) and best-effort appended to `~/.dsh/dsh-hooks/history.jsonl` (0600) — for future UIs and debugging. The ring buffer seeds from the JSONL at startup and live-syncs new appends on every web-panel read (including appends from other dsh processes sharing the file, e.g. a task-board Host), so history survives restarts. Records never contain secrets (env vars never enter records):

```yaml
- id: dsh-hooks
  name: dsh-hooks
  config:
    history:
      enabled: true        # optional: persist to disk (default true)
      max: 500             # optional: in-memory ring buffer size
      # path: '…'          # optional: custom JSONL path (default ~/.dsh/dsh-hooks/history.jsonl)
    hooks: […]
```

Each record: timestamp, kind (run/notify), event, command, session, outcome (spawned / exit-0 / exit-nonzero / timeout / skipped / sent / send-failed, …), exit code, duration, stderr tail. Disk failures are swallowed silently — history never blocks a hook.

## dry-run: verify config

Simulate an event to see which hooks would fire and why the others are filtered:

```sh
dsh-hooks dry-run turn/end --reason completed --profile web
# ✅ [1] [turn/end when=completed] run: node notify-feishu.mjs
# ⏭ [2] [turn/end when=error] run: … —— when 不匹配（期望 error，实际 completed）
# ⏭ [3] [tool/call] run: … —— 事件不匹配（tool/call ≠ turn/end）
# 共 1 个 hook 会触发。加 --execute 实际执行（真实副作用！）

dsh-hooks dry-run tool/call --tool ssh_exec --execute   # end-to-end: actually run the matching hooks
```

`dry-run` reads the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (the `id: dsh-hooks` block) and validates the config (bad regexes fail here).

## Web GUI

After install, the dsh web settings panel gains a "Hooks" section (beside General and Plugins):

- **Status badges**: plugin version, hook count, history count, plus live diagnostics (in-flight runs, recent failures)
- **Manual tester**: pick an event (14 kinds) + reason/tool; "Simulate" shows the per-hook match report, "Execute" really triggers the matching hooks; the report clears when the inputs change
- **Notify-channel tests**: fire a test notification at the webhook (optional Slack summary) / desktop channel and show the payload preview
- **Feishu connect**: scan-to-connect inside the panel — the QR code renders inline (with expiry countdown and a cancel button); after the scan the app is created, credentials + hook config are written, and the connected summary offers a one-click test card, an inline truncation-length editor (50–5000 chars, default 300, with a content preview), a re-connect flow, and a disconnect (optionally removing the Feishu hooks)
- **Hook list / editor**: a read-only list of the current hooks (event/when/match/run/notify + timeout/retry fields) with one-click "copy YAML"; the "edit" mode turns it into a form editor whose changes are validated (regexes, run-notify exclusivity) and written back to `cordis.patch.yml` with an automatic backup
- **Execution-history timeline**: at the bottom of the card, **collapsed by default** (the toggle state persists in localStorage; "expand" opens the latest 30 triggers: time / event / command / outcome / stderr tail), refreshed every 5s

CLI/headless environments are unaffected: the browser half loads only in the web GUI and the core has no UI runtime dependencies.

## Web profile HTTP routes

In the web profile (when the shared webServer service exists) dsh-hooks registers `/dsh-hooks/*` routes, restricted to loopback by default and configurable through the environment variable below — CLI/headless environments never see them:

| Route | Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/dsh-hooks/status` | GET | plugin version, hook count, history count, the **current hook list**, and live runner stats |
| `/dsh-hooks/history?n=50` | GET | the latest N execution records (JSON envelope) |
| `/dsh-hooks/test` | POST | simulate an event: `{"event":"tool/call","tool":"ssh_exec","execute":false}` returns a per-hook match report; `execute: true` actually runs the matching hooks |
| `/dsh-hooks/notify/test` | POST | fire a test notification at a channel: `{"channel":"webhook","url":…,"slack":true}` or `{"channel":"desktop"}`; returns the payload preview |
| `/dsh-hooks/hooks/save` | POST | save the hook list: `{"profile":"web","hooks":[…]}` — validates (events, reasons, regexes, run-notify exclusivity), writes back to cordis.patch.yml with an automatic backup |
| `/dsh-hooks/feishu/status` | GET | Feishu connection summary (app id / target masked, secret never leaves the server) + the scan-session snapshot + the truncation length + a content preview |
| `/dsh-hooks/feishu/setup` | POST | start a scan session: `{"profile":"web","resultMaxChars":800}`; returns the QR URL / PNG data URL / expiry (409 while one is pending) |
| `/dsh-hooks/feishu/cancel` | POST | cancel the pending scan session (aborts the registerApp wait) |
| `/dsh-hooks/feishu/config` | POST | update the card truncation length: `{"resultMaxChars":800}` (50–5000); effective immediately, credentials preserved |
| `/dsh-hooks/feishu/test` | POST | send a test card with the stored credentials |
| `/dsh-hooks/feishu/disconnect` | POST | disconnect: delete the credential file; `removeHooks: true` also drops the hooks referencing notify-feishu.mjs (with a backup) |

POSTs require `application/json` in every access mode (blocks cross-site form CSRF). The web profile also gets a systemPrompt section announcing the plugin to agents.

### Configure HTTP source IP access

Set `DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS` in the **environment of the process running `dsh web`**. This is not a `cordis.patch.yml` field and does not require changing your hooks configuration.

| Environment variable value | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Unset, empty, or whitespace-only | Allows only `127.0.0.1`, `::1`, and `::ffff:127.0.0.1`, preserving the default behavior |
| `*` | Disables source IP filtering |
| `192.168.1.100,10.0.0.2` | Allows only IPs in the comma-separated list |

Leading and trailing whitespace is removed. `local` and `all` are not special values: anything other than a blank value or a standalone `*` is matched as an IP list. Allowlist mode **does not implicitly allow loopback connections**; include `127.0.0.1,::1` explicitly if you need local access.

Matching ignores surrounding whitespace, letter case, and the `::ffff:` prefix on each address, so `192.168.1.100` matches `::ffff:192.168.1.100`. Hostnames, ports, CIDR ranges, and wildcards within a list are not supported. Invalid entries do not trigger a fallback to loopback-only or unrestricted access. IPv6 matching compares strings after this normalization, without expanding or compressing IPv6 notation; use the representation observed by the server.

#### Direct startup

PowerShell: choose one setting and start the service in the **same terminal**.

```powershell
# Loopback only (leaving the variable unset also works)
$env:DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS = ''

# Alternatively: allow a client and retain local access
# $env:DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS = '192.168.1.100,127.0.0.1,::1'

# Alternatively: allow any source IP (secure external access first)
# $env:DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS = '*'

dsh web
```

Linux/macOS shell: choose one of these commands.

```sh
DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS='' dsh web
DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS='192.168.1.100,127.0.0.1,::1' dsh web
DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS='*' dsh web
```

Restart the corresponding `dsh web` process after changing its terminal or service-manager environment; a running process does not inherit subsequent changes. Writing the variable to `.env` alone does not pass it to the process; your launcher or container configuration must load it explicitly.

#### Docker Compose

Add the variable to `environment` on the **service running DSH**, preserving its existing image, ports, volumes, and other settings. Replace the example service name `dsh` with your actual service name:

```yaml
services:
  dsh:
    environment:
      DSH_HOOKS_ALLOWED_IPS: "192.168.1.100,127.0.0.1,::1"
      # Use "" for loopback only or "*" for unrestricted IPs (quote the asterisk).
```

Recreate the service container to apply the new environment, for example with `docker compose up -d --force-recreate dsh`. Restarting an existing container alone does not update its environment configuration. If using a Compose `.env` file, also reference the variable through the service's `environment` or pass it through `env_file`.

#### Proxies, security, and verification

- The check uses `req.socket.remoteAddress`, ignoring `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Real-IP`, and `Forwarded`. Behind Docker/NAT/reverse proxies, this may be a gateway or proxy IP instead of the browser machine's IP.
- Allowlisting a proxy IP allows all clients forwarded by that proxy. A local proxy can also forward external requests as loopback connections. Enforce client restrictions at the proxy. Loopback-only refers to the server's (or container's) loopback connections, not exclusively to browsers on that machine.
- `*` removes the source IP restriction from sensitive operations including history access, configuration changes, and hook execution. An IP allowlist is not authentication: protect these endpoints with a trusted network or external authentication, and do not expose them directly to untrusted networks.
- This variable affects only `/dsh-hooks/*`; it does not change listen addresses, ports, firewall rules, or other plugins' permissions.

Request `GET /dsh-hooks/status` from both allowed and denied clients using your actual host and port. Requests passing this plugin's check receive the normal status JSON; requests rejected by this plugin receive HTTP 403:

```json
{"ok":false,"error":{"code":"forbidden","message":"IP not allowed"}}
```

If an allowlisted client still receives this error, confirm the variable reached the actual service process, then check whether the server sees the client IP or a proxy/gateway IP. For connection timeouts or refused connections, also check listen addresses, port mappings, and network rules.

## Feishu notification example

Two ways to connect — the **Web GUI scan** (recommended, no terminal) or the one-shot setup CLI. Both create the Feishu app via a QR-code scan and write the same hook config.

### Option 1: scan in the Web GUI

Open the dsh web settings → "Hooks" section → "Feishu connect", fill in the profile (default `web`) and press the connect button:

1. The panel shows the Feishu authorization QR code inline (with expiry countdown)
2. Scanning creates an app named 「DSH 通知机器人」 (only the `im:message:send_as_bot` permission); the scanning user becomes the notification target
3. The connected summary offers "send test card", an inline truncation-length editor (50–5000 chars, default 300, effective immediately), and "re-connect" (swap the bound app)
4. Restart `dsh web` for the hooks to take effect

### Option 2: setup CLI

```sh
dsh-hooks feishu-setup                 # default profile: web
dsh-hooks feishu-setup --profile work  # another profile
dsh-hooks feishu-test                  # send a test card with the stored credentials
```

`feishu-setup` prints a QR code (and opens it in your browser), waits for you to scan it with Feishu, then creates an app named 「DSH 通知机器人」 with message-send permission.

Both options write the same files:

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.dsh/dsh-hooks/feishu-config.json` | app id/secret + your open_id as the notification target (0600, never committed); `result_max_chars` sets the card content truncation (default 300, editable in the Web GUI) |
| `~/.dsh/dsh-hooks/notify-feishu.mjs` | stable copy of the notify script the hooks reference |
| `~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml` | dsh-hooks block: `turn/end` (completed/error/aborted) + `approval/asked` + `agent/error` card hooks |

Restart `dsh web` afterwards — you will get cards when turns finish, approvals are asked, or the agent errors.

### Option 3: manual configuration

Prefer wiring it by hand? See [`examples/notify-feishu.mjs`](examples/notify-feishu.mjs) — a zero-dependency script that posts turn-completion / approval notices through the Feishu **app API** (works without a group custom bot). Configure it like:

```yaml
- id: dsh-hooks
  name: dsh-hooks
  config:
    hooks:
      - on: 'turn/end'
        when: 'completed'
        run: 'node D:/path/to/examples/notify-feishu.mjs'
      - on: 'approval/asked'
        run: 'node D:/path/to/examples/notify-feishu.mjs --approval'
```

with `DSH_HOOKS_FEISHU_APP_ID` / `DSH_HOOKS_FEISHU_APP_SECRET` / `DSH_HOOKS_FEISHU_TO` in the process environment (never in config files).

## Security

Hooks execute arbitrary commands with the dsh process privileges. Only configure commands you trust. Secrets belong in environment variables or the dsh credential store — never in `cordis.patch.yml`.

## Design

Follows the dsh plugin conventions: `dsh.bundle.patch` mounts the plugin row, the plugin listens to the durable `session/event` firehose plus agent lifecycle events, and emissions are irreversible side effects that compensate rather than block (failures warn, never retry).

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check     # typecheck + test + build
```
