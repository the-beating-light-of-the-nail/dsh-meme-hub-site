**English** | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

**An embedded VS Code editor plugin for DeepSeek Harness** — embeds a full code-server (complete VS Code) inside the DSH web UI. Every time the agent writes or edits a file, the editor pops a red/green diff and jumps to the first changed line — you literally watch the AI work.

## 1. Features

- **Two backends: embedded / local** — embedded code-server by default; or switch to **local VS Code** and move follow/diff/locking into your own desktop editor
- **Real VS Code, not a toy editor** — the embedded one is code-server 4.x (full VS Code kernel): extensions, themes, keybindings and the Git panel all work
- **Follow mode** — when the agent calls `write`/`edit`, the editor opens a red/green diff view of that file and scrolls to the first changed line; DSH also renders its own read-only diff tab, so you can watch either side
- **File locking** — while the agent is writing a file it becomes read-only in the editor (prevents you and the AI overwriting each other); it unlocks automatically when the write finishes
- **Workspace follows the session** — one DSH process runs one code-server; when the active session's workspace changes, the editor switches to that directory (restarting code-server when needed)
- **Persistent iframe** — the editor page stays attached to `<body>`; switching tabs only hides/shows it instead of starting a new VS Code session every click
- **Settings page integration** — a collapsible card under Settings → Plugins → Plugin Configuration: follow toggle, auto-start, port, code-server home. Everything applies live and persists (`~/.dsh/settings.yaml`)
- **Zero dependencies** — both host and client halves are hand-written vanilla JS with no npm packages; the settings schema is a hand-rolled schemastery-compatible shape, no `@deepseek-ai/schemastery` needed

## 2. How it works

```
┌─ DSH process ─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  host.js (host-plane cordis plugin, one per process)       │
│   · listens to tools/pre-execute & tools/result events     │
│     of every session                                       │
│   · captures write/edit target paths, reads before/after   │
│   · manages the code-server child (spawn/restart/retry)    │
│   · exposes via webServer:                                 │
│       /__dsh-vsceditor/state|action   (control plane)      │
│       /__dsh-vsceditor-<rand>/events  (SSE → extension)    │
│       /__dsh-vsceditor-<rand>/rpc     (extension → host)   │
└───────┬──────────────────────────────▲────────────────────┘
        │ SSE: hello/follow/edit/lock/unlock/reveal
        │                              POST: ready/ack/log
┌───────▼──────────────────────────────┴────────────────────┐
│  code-server (separate process, --auth none, 127.0.0.1)    │
│   └─ dsh-bridge extension (vscode-ext/dsh-bridge)          │
│        edit message → opens red/green diff at the change   │
│        lock → file read-only; unlock → restores            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ▲ iframe (client.js registers a conversation.view
          tab "Editor", persistent on body across tab switches)
```

Message semantics follow ACP `session/update`: `edit {path, oldText, newText, firstLine}` is pushed by the host with computed diff stats; the extension renders it. The host mounts unscoped, so it sees tool events from all sessions (scoped events flow up the scope chain).

## 3. Requirements

- DeepSeek Harness (dsh) web profile (this plugin is a profile bundle mounted on the host plane)
- macOS or Linux (Windows untested; code-server has no official Windows build)
- **Embedded mode**: a code-server installation (see 4.2); **local VS Code mode**: desktop VS Code. You need at least one of the two — **the plugin works without code-server, but only in local VS Code mode**

## 4. Installation

### 4.1 Install the plugin

**Option A: from GitHub (recommended)**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:k-ying/dsh-vsceditor
```

`dsh plugin add` adds the package to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json` dependencies and registers it in `dsh.profile.bundles` automatically (the plugin self-mounts via `cordis.patch.yml`; no manual composition edits needed).

**Option B: from a local directory**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/k-ying/dsh-vsceditor.git
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-vsceditor
```

### 4.2 Install code-server (required for embedded mode)

> ⚠️ **Do not skip this if you want the default embedded editor.** The plugin does not ship the code-server runtime (~100MB). Without it, embedded mode is unavailable — the Editor tab will report "code-server not found" and offer to switch you to **local VS Code mode** (feature-equivalent, see 5.1).

**Option 1: one-click install (recommended).** Open the Editor tab (or Settings → Plugins → Embedded VS Code editor) and click **⬇ Install code-server in one click** — a dialog shows the download URL, live progress percentage, and install/startup steps (cancellable at any time), and the editor opens automatically when done. Installs to `~/.dsh-editor`, shared by all workspaces.

**Option 2: global CLI install** (equivalent; useful when the panel is unreachable):

```sh
sh ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/dsh-vsceditor/scripts/install-code-server.sh ~/.dsh-editor
```

To give one workspace its own code-server, run without arguments (installs to `.dsh-editor` in the current directory, which takes precedence over the global one):

```sh
cd <your DSH workspace>   # e.g. ~/Documents/AI
sh ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/dsh-vsceditor/scripts/install-code-server.sh
```

The script downloads the official code-server release for your platform (macOS arm64/x64, Linux x64/arm64/armhf) and extracts it. Version is pinned to 4.133.0; override with the `DSH_VSCEDITOR_VERSION` environment variable.

Manual install also works: extract code-server into any of these locations (in lookup order):

1. The `code-server directory` field in the settings card (highest priority)
2. The `$DSH_VSCEDITOR_HOME` environment variable
3. `<workspace>/.dsh-editor` (workspace level)
4. `~/.dsh-editor` (global, recommended)

The directory must contain `code-server/bin/code-server`.

> 📁 **Editor runtime data (user-data, config, logs) is NOT stored in your workspace** — it lives in the global `~/.dsh-editor/workspaces/<hash>-<workspace-name>/`, isolated per workspace (the same model as VS Code's user-level data directory), so your project folder stays clean. Older versions used `<workspace>/.dsh-editor`; workspaces that already have one keep using it to preserve their data.

#### Windows (experimental)

code-server [does not publish Windows builds](https://github.com/coder/code-server/issues/1397), and a plain `npm install -g code-server` is broken on Windows (both the postinstall script and argon2 native compilation fail). This plugin ships `scripts/install-code-server.ps1` to work around both, with a technique inspired by [naspenang/code-server-windows](https://github.com/naspenang/code-server-windows) (MIT): skip postinstall, install dependencies manually, and **borrow native modules from an installed desktop VS Code**.

Prerequisites:

- Windows 10/11 + PowerShell
- **Desktop VS Code** installed, at a version **exactly matching** the VS Code bundled in code-server (the script verifies this and reports the expected version; use `-CodeServerVersion` to pick a matching code-server version, or `-SkipVSCodeVersionCheck` to force)

```powershell
cd <your DSH workspace>
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\profiles\web\node_modules\dsh-vsceditor\scripts\install-code-server.ps1"
```

Layout produced (what the host looks up on Windows):

```
<workspace>\.dsh-editor\code-server\node\node.exe
<workspace>\.dsh-editor\code-server\runtime\node_modules\code-server\out\node\entry.js
```

Note: this path is not widely verified; it only guarantees local 127.0.0.1 use. If you hit problems, **WSL2 runs the officially maintained Linux flow** with an identical experience to macOS/Linux — a safer choice.

### 4.3 Start

```sh
dsh web
```

An Editor tab appears in the top bar; click it and wait a few seconds for code-server to come up. The status dot next to the tab label: gray = loading, green = extension connected, yellow = waiting for the extension, red = not running / code-server not installed / bridge not mounted.

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 Local VS Code mode

Switch **Editor backend** to **Local VS Code** under Settings → Plugins → Plugin Configuration (mutually exclusive with embedded code-server, applies instantly), or click the **connection wizard** button on the Editor tab's status card:

1. The plugin auto-detects local VS Code (macOS `.app` and Spotlight, Windows standard install dirs and `where`, Linux `/usr/bin` and `which`); if not found, set the path manually in settings
2. Without the bridge extension, the status card shows an **Install extension into local VS Code** button — one click copies it to `~/.vscode/extensions/` (home dir, no privileges needed); on failure it prints the manual copy source/target paths
3. Reload Window in desktop VS Code and **open the same workspace as the DSH session** — the extension only serves the window whose workspace matches, so multiple windows never cross-talk
4. From then on, follow diff and file locking behave exactly like embedded mode; the extension auto-updates with the plugin version (just Reload Window when prompted)

How: environment variables cannot be injected into an already-running desktop app, so the host writes bridge coordinates (port/token/workspace) to `~/.dsh-editor/bridge.json` and the extension polls it to handshake. One extension codebase serves both modes automatically; embedded mode is unaffected.

#### Workspace Trust

Desktop VS Code enables [Restricted Mode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) for newly opened folders. The plugin fully adapts to it:

- The bridge extension declares `untrustedWorkspaces: limited` support — **it activates and keeps the handshake even in untrusted windows**, but executes no edit/reveal sync commands
- During this, the DSH status dot turns yellow ("waiting for workspace trust"), and both the editor tab and the connection wizard say so; the extension also shows a one-time "Manage Workspace Trust" prompt inside VS Code
- Click **Trust** in VS Code's trust dialog (or Command Palette → `Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust`) and everything **resumes automatically** — no Reload needed (the extension listens to `onDidGrantWorkspaceTrust` and reconnects)
- Embedded code-server launches with `--disable-workspace-trust` and never has this issue

Recommendation: your DSH workspaces are your own directories, so just trust them; if all sessions live under one parent (e.g. `~/Documents/AI`), trusting the parent folder settles it once and for all.

### 5.2 Follow mode

On by default. After each agent `write`/`edit` lands:

- The editor switches to that file's diff view (old left, new right) and scrolls to the first changed line
- You can uncheck **Follow** in the editor tab's toolbar anytime; recent changes are still recorded (recent list), it just stops popping views
- **Toggleable from inside the editor too**: click the `DSH · follow/edit` status bar button in VS Code for a menu (toggle follow / reconnect), or Command Palette → `DSH Bridge: Toggle Follow Mode`; the extension sends the request back to DSH and all sides sync
- Only want edits inside the workspace? Check **Follow workspace files only** in the settings card — writes outside the workspace go to the recent list without popping diffs

### 5.3 File locking

When the agent starts writing a file, that file becomes read-only in the editor (status bar hint) and unlocks when the write completes. This is an anti-conflict hint, not a security boundary.

### 5.4 Settings card

Settings → Plugins → Plugin Configuration → "Embedded VS Code editor" (collapsed by default, click the header to expand):

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `editorBackend` | string | `embedded` | Editor backend: `embedded` = embedded code-server; `local` = local desktop VS Code |
| `follow` | boolean | `true` | Follow DSH edits: pop the red/green diff and jump to the changed line |
| `followWorkspaceOnly` | boolean | `false` | Follow workspace files only: out-of-workspace changes are recorded but pop no diff |
| `autoStart` | boolean | `true` | Launch code-server automatically when DSH starts; when off, start it manually from the Editor tab |
| `port` | number | `0` | code-server listen port; `0` = random (18200–18900); changing it restarts the editor |
| `codeServerHome` | string | `""` | Manually specify the code-server install directory; empty = auto-lookup in the order above |
| `vscodePath` | string | `""` | Manually specify the local VS Code path (code CLI or .app/Code.exe); empty = auto-detect |
| `language` | string | `auto` | UI language: `auto` = follow the DSH UI language (falls back to browser language); `pt-BR`/`es` are never auto-detected because DSH itself only ships zh/en — pick them explicitly here |

Writes persist to the `dsh-vsceditor` section of `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` and survive restarts. You can also add `config:` to the plugin row in `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml` as a composition-level base (user layer overrides base layer).

### 5.5 Shortcuts / commands

In the VS Code command palette (`Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- `DSH Bridge: Toggle Follow Mode` — toggle follow mode (or click the `DSH` status bar button, which offers a menu with the switch)
- `DSH Bridge: Reconnect` — reconnect the bridge manually (rarely needed — the extension reconnects on its own)

## 6. Troubleshooting

**The Editor tab shows "code-server not installed" / "code-server not found"**
code-server is not installed or not on the lookup path. Two options: ① run the install script in 4.2 (or fill in the `code-server directory` in the settings card); ② if you don't want it, click the **Use local VS Code →** button on the page — the plugin switches to local mode and opens the connection wizard.

**Local mode stuck at "waiting for workspace trust" (yellow dot)**
VS Code Restricted Mode is blocking edit sync. Trust the workspace in VS Code (Command Palette → `Workspaces: Manage Workspace Trust`); it resumes automatically without Reload. See the "Workspace Trust" subsection of 5.1.

**Stuck at "waiting for extension" (yellow dot)**
The extension host only starts while a code-server window is open. Click into the Editor tab and wait a few seconds; if the page is stale (code-server restarted), refresh the whole DSH page.

**Edits don't pop diffs**
① Is the tab status dot green? ② Is **Follow** checked in the toolbar? ③ Extension logs: restart DSH with `DSH_BRIDGE_DEBUG=1` and read `/tmp/dsh-bridge-debug.log` (local mode: `~/.dsh-editor/bridge-ext.log`).

**Port taken / want a different port**
Change the port in the settings card; the editor restarts onto the new port after saving.

**Leftover code-server processes**
DSH does not force-kill detached children on exit. Clean up manually: `pkill -f 'code-server.*--auth none'`.

**Settings → Plugins → Plugin Configuration renders blank**
A pitfall from this plugin's 0.1.x era: a settings schema missing `toJSON` takes down the whole tab. Fixed in 0.2.0; if it still happens, file an issue with the `dsh-vsceditor` section of `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` attached.

## 7. Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-vsceditor
```

Optionally remove runtime data: `~/.dsh-editor` (including per-workspace runtime data under `workspaces/`; legacy installs may also have `<workspace>/.dsh-editor`), `~/.vscode/extensions/dsh.dsh-bridge`, and the `dsh-vsceditor` section of `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`.

## 8. Security notes

- code-server launches with `--auth none` but **listens on 127.0.0.1 only**, never exposed to the LAN; do not rebind it to 0.0.0.0
- Bridge endpoints (SSE/RPC) carry a per-boot random token handed to the extension via environment variables
- The plugin collects and uploads nothing; code-server starts with `--disable-telemetry --disable-update-check`

## 9. Directory layout

```
dsh-vsceditor/
├── cordis.patch.yml              # profile bundle self-mount patch (host-plane row)
├── package.json                  # dsh.bundle.patch / dsh.client declarations
├── lib/
│   ├── host.js                   # host half: process mgmt, event bridge, settings namespace
│   └── client.js                 # client half: tab iframe, settings card (hand-written bundle)
├── scripts/
│   ├── install-code-server.sh    # code-server download/install script (macOS/Linux)
│   └── install-code-server.ps1   # code-server install script (Windows, experimental)
└── vscode-ext/
    └── dsh-bridge/               # bridge extension injected via --extensions-dir
        ├── package.json
        └── extension.js
```

`vscode-ext/extensions.json` and `vscode-ext/.obsolete` are runtime files regenerated by code-server with machine-local paths; both are gitignored.

## 10. Development

After changing `lib/host.js`, restart DSH; after `lib/client.js`, just refresh the page (the bundle route reads from disk per request). Verify the profile still assembles the composition:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

### Versioning rule

The plugin (root `package.json`) and the bridge extension (`vscode-ext/dsh-bridge/package.json`) keep **major.minor in sync** — e.g. plugin `0.3.x` pairs with extension `0.3.x`; patch digits may drift independently. The host compares the installed extension version against the bundled one (`vscode-ext/dsh-bridge/package.json`'s `version`) and re-copies to `~/.vscode/extensions/` with a Reload Window prompt when they differ, so upgrading the plugin never needs a manual extension reinstall.
