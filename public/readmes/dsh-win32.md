# dsh-win32

## Fix DSH on Windows. No WSL.

**Official PowerShell. Workspace Write. One command.**

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 setup
```

Current DeepSeek Harness already includes persistent PowerShell and a Windows ACL sandbox. dsh-win32 checks that official stack, finds known Windows failures, applies the repairs it can prove safe, and creates a desktop shortcut.

It does not install Git, PowerShell, busybox, WSL, or another DSH bundle on the current path.

## See the current setup

**Reproduced setup flow. This is not a screen recording.**

![Reproduced dsh-win32 setup on current DSH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjh9714/dsh-win32/e727bef09b56ca3f52024e3362912d3c243f309f/assets/demo.gif)

The command checks the official persistent PowerShell and Workspace Write packages, creates the shortcut, and leaves the profile on the stock Minimal preset.

## What setup does

- Checks the latest published DSH Windows package contract
- Checks PowerShell 7 and known broken koffi runtimes
- Creates a `DeepSeek Harness` desktop shortcut for the Web profile
- Leaves the official profile and preset unchanged
- Shows the exact next steps for a first session

After setup, open DSH, add a workspace, choose the stock **Minimal** preset, and keep **Workspace Write** enabled.

Use another profile without creating a shortcut.

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 setup --profile desktop --no-shortcut
```

`--sandboxed` remains accepted for old notes and scripts. Current DSH already provides the sandbox, so the flag makes no extra change.

## Doctor and safe repair

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 doctor
npx dsh-win32 doctor --json
npx dsh-win32 fix
```

`doctor` verifies the published DSH Windows stack and checks local Windows failures. Its JSON output follows the `dsh-doctor/v1` envelope.

`fix` only repairs installed koffi versions that are known broken or fail a real runtime load. It verifies the load again after repair.

## Legacy DSH

DSH rc.6 and older did not ship the current official PowerShell stack. The previous Git Bash and busybox presets remain available behind an explicit flag.

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 setup --legacy
npx dsh-win32 setup --legacy --sandboxed
npx dsh-win32 doctor --legacy
```

The legacy Git Bash preset needs `danger-full-access`. The legacy busybox preset can run in Workspace Write. Neither path installs Git automatically.

[Read the implementation evidence, compatibility history, and complete legacy limitations](./docs/windows-details.md).

## Honest limits

- The current path checks published DSH package metadata. It cannot prove that a separately cached launcher is the same version.
- PowerShell 7 is recommended. dsh-win32 does not install it.
- A legacy busybox session uses ash rather than Bash.
- Editing a legacy encoded file writes UTF-8.
- Treat `C:\tmp` as outside the expected legacy write fence until the upstream Windows path issue is fixed.
