# dsh-win32

## Persistent shell on Windows. No WSL.

**One command. Workspace Write.**

Run DSH Minimal mode on Windows with the sandboxed preset.

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 setup --sandboxed
```

DeepSeek Harness already runs natively on Windows with PowerShell. dsh-win32 adds persistent Minimal presets, including one that survives Workspace Write.

This preset uses busybox ash, so Git Bash and WSL are not required.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> dsh-win32 0.15.1 supports DSH rc.6. DSH rc.8 and later already ship Minimal with PowerShell on Windows. The current DSH subprocess package still pins `node-pty@1.2.0-beta.15`, which fails this plugin's Windows PTY path before the first write. Use stock Minimal on current DSH or follow [the upstream compatibility report](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness/discussions/2851) until that dependency changes.

## See it work

**Illustrated installation reproduction. This is not a real capture.**

**Real Windows session.**

![A real Windows session fixes a failing test in Workspace Write](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjh9714/dsh-win32/3d7d4d4cdbb26729e14fe3d4547102b4ccc77f25/assets/shot-persistent-sandboxed.png)

The real session runs a failing test, reads the source, applies a fix, and reruns it to `all tests passed` in `Workspace Write`.

## Choose a preset

After setup, start DSH, add a workspace, and choose the preset.

- **Minimal (Windows, sandboxed)** uses busybox ash inside `Workspace Write`. Install it with `npx dsh-win32 setup --sandboxed`.
- **Minimal (Windows)** uses Git Bash and needs `danger-full-access`. Install it with `npx dsh-win32 setup` after installing [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com).

Using DSH Desktop instead of the Web profile?

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 setup --sandboxed --profile desktop --no-shortcut
```

Restart DSH Desktop after setup, then choose **Minimal (Windows, sandboxed)**.

## Doctor

```powershell
npx dsh-win32 doctor
```

`doctor` lists known Windows setup traps and their safe fixes. Its koffi check verifies both the installed version and a real runtime load, so a skipped install script cannot produce a false pass. Use `npx dsh-win32 fix` for fixes it can apply safely.

## Honest limits

- The sandboxed preset is ash, not Bash. It does not support arrays or `[[ ]]`.
- Legacy-encoded files are read automatically, but saving an edited file writes UTF-8.
- Treat `C:\tmp` as outside the expected write fence until the upstream Windows path issue is fixed.
