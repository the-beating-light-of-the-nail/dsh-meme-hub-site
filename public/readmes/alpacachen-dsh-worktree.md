## Features

- Create a Git worktree from a new-session action or any Git Workspace menu.
- Choose the current branch or the repository's main branch.
- Register and open the new worktree as a DSH Workspace with an isolated session.
- Create task branches as `task/<name>`.
- No additional service or project configuration.
- Supports DSH themes, Chinese, and English.

## Usage

### Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @alpacachen/dsh-simple-worktree
```

Restart `dsh web` after installation.

You can also install from GitHub with `dsh plugin --profile web add github:alpacachen/dsh-worktree`.

### Create from a new session

1. Open **New Session** in a Git Workspace.
2. Choose **Create worktree** above the composer.
3. Enter a task name. The repository's main branch is selected by default.
4. Click **Create and open**.

### Create from a Workspace menu

1. Open a Git Workspace menu and choose **Create worktree**.
2. Enter a task name, such as `login-fix`.
3. Choose **Current branch** or **Main branch**.
4. Click **Create and open**.

The worktree is created at:

```text
project.worktrees/login-fix/
└── branch: task/login-fix
```

The new Workspace is named `<parent>/<task>`. Removing the worktree Workspace does not delete its Git branch.
