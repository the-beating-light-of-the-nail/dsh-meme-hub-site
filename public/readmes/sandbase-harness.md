A local-first runtime for AI agents. Sessions, sandboxed tools, memory,
credentials, audit trails, and a built-in Console — all running on your
machine or in your own infrastructure.

> Building with DeepSeek Harness? The independent [DeepSeek Harness Handbook](https://github.com/sandbaseai/deepseek-harness-handbook) provides source-backed runtime guides, multilingual troubleshooting, and a regularly updated [Agent-first resource map](https://sandbaseai.github.io/deepseek-harness-handbook/awesome-deepseek-harness-resources.html).

![SandBase Harness architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness/66dc765a9d781846bd7aed45d72fe4603715136d/docs/assets/sandbase-harness-architecture.svg)

> Looking for a lightweight bridge instead of a full runtime? [SandBase CLI](https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli)
> connects 25 AI client targets to 2,000+ models and APIs through a local stdio MCP bridge.
> If it fits your workflow, [star SandBase CLI](https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli/stargazers)
> so other agent users can discover it.

> Need hosted model and media APIs instead? SandBase provides one interface for
> [LLM, image, and video generation APIs](https://blog.sandbase.ai/unified-ai-api-llm-image-video-2026/),
> with the [API quickstart](https://www.sandbase.ai/docs/getting-started/) covering keys and first calls.

```bash
git clone --branch v0.3.8 --depth 1 https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness.git
cd sandbase-harness
npm ci
npm run build
mkdir ../my-agents && cd ../my-agents
node ../sandbase-harness/dist/index.js init
node ../sandbase-harness/dist/index.js start
# open http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard
```

Choose SandBase Harness when you need more than a model loop:

| Need | What Harness provides |
| --- | --- |
| Run generated code safely | Local, Docker, Kubernetes, and self-hosted worker sandboxes |
| Inspect long-running agents | Persistent sessions, resumable event streams, audit, and replay |
| Control tool access | MCP toolsets, credential vaults, permission policies, and approvals |
| Operate any model | OpenAI, Anthropic, MiniMax, and OpenAI-compatible providers, including DeepSeek V4 |
| Keep infrastructure yours | Local-first SQLite and file storage with no required hosted control plane |

If this runtime solves a real agent-infrastructure problem for you,
[star the repository](https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness) so other builders can find it.

## Find SandBase Harness

The project is also discoverable through these independent ecosystem directories:

- [Official MCP Registry](https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0.1/servers?search=io.github.sandbaseai%2Fsandbase-harness)
- [MCP Market](https://mcpmarket.com/server/sandbase-harness)
- [OpenAgentSkill — code-review](https://www.openagentskill.com/skills/sandbaseai-sandbase-harness-code-review)

- [FindHarness](https://findharness.com/plugins/sandbaseai-sandbase-harness)
- [dsh-market](https://dshmarket.com/p/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness/)

These listings are independent directories; the repository and its release metadata
remain the source of truth.

### Try it in Codespaces

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness?quickstart=1)

The included development container installs dependencies and builds the runtime.
When the terminal is ready, start the server on the forwarded port:

```bash
node dist/index.js start --host 0.0.0.0
```

Open the forwarded **SandBase Harness Console** port, then configure a model in
**Settings > Models**. Codespaces usage may be billed by GitHub; the local
quick start below remains free and keeps all runtime data on your machine.

## Why

Agent SDKs handle the model loop. Production agents need more: persistent
sessions, tool governance, sandbox boundaries, credential handling, memory,
auditability, and a UI for humans to inspect what happened. `managed-agents`
is that runtime layer — not a visual workflow builder and not another model SDK.

## Features

- Claude Managed Agents-style `/v1` API and local Console
- SQLite-backed agents, sessions, environments, credential vaults, memory
  stores, files, skills, and API keys — SQLite metadata by default
- local file/skill bytes stored in the workspace state directory
- Resumable Server-Sent Events for session replay and debugging
- One active model provider boundary configured through Settings V2
- Sandbox backends: local process, Docker (per-session containers), Kubernetes
  (kubectl exec/cp), self-hosted worker queue
- Settings V2: one workspace model vendor, loop engine, storage, memory,
  sandbox — with validation, form/JSON modes, and restart flow
- MCP toolsets, permission policies, built-in tools, and skill packages
- DeepSeek Harness bridge over MCP stdio for agents, sessions, streamed turns,
  artifacts, and cancellation
- TypeScript SDK at `managed-agents/sdk`
- Release gate: `npm run release:check`

## Start with a use case

See the [Showcase](docs/showcase.md) for three practical paths: an auditable
coding agent, DeepSeek Harness as an interactive front end, and controlled code
execution across Local, Docker, Kubernetes, and self-hosted sandboxes.

For client-specific setup, see the [installation guide](llms-install.md),
including the pinned Cline CLI command and the Docker MCP Bridge configuration.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+
- npm 10+
- A model provider API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, MiniMax, or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint)
- Docker (optional, for Docker-backed sandboxes)

## DeepSeek Harness

Run this project as a DSH plugin instead of treating `dsh-plugin` as discovery
metadata only. Install the bundle into a DSH profile, start `managed-agents`,
then boot that profile:

```bash
export MANAGED_AGENTS_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
# Preferred: install a local source checkout after `npm run build`.
dsh plugin --profile web add -w ../sandbase-harness
# Git URL fallback. Keep HTTPS; do not convert the spec to SSH.
# dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness.git
dsh web
```

The profile installs the verified source checkout directly; it does not resolve
the unrelated unscoped npm package. A git-hosted install runs `prepare` only
when `dist/` is missing. Keep the HTTPS git spec; converting it to SSH fails on
Windows hosts without GitHub SSH access. The patch starts the bundled MCP entry over
stdio. DSH can then list agents,
create and run sessions, inspect results and artifacts, and stop work through
native `mcp__sandbase__*` tools. See
[`examples/deepseek-harness`](examples/deepseek-harness/README.md) for the full
tool list and authenticated-runtime configuration.

For a walkthrough that starts with DSH and adds this runtime as a real
third-party plugin, read the
[DeepSeek Harness developer guide](https://blog.sandbase.ai/deepseek-harness-developer-preview-2026/#add-a-real-third-party-runtime-plugin).

Pair the plugin with SandBase Skills to give the same DSH project a portable,
source-verifiable research workflow:

```bash
npx --yes github:sandbaseai/sandbase-skills add multi-source-search
dsh web
```

This installs the complete Skill into `.dsh/skills/multi-source-search`, DSH's
project-scoped discovery directory. It runs from GitHub source and needs no
SandBase account when DSH already provides web/search tools.

For a complete, reproducible workflow that combines the evidence ledger with
sandboxed execution, credentials, audit, and replay, read
[Build an Auditable Research Agent](https://blog.sandbase.ai/auditable-research-agent-evidence-ledger-sandbox-replay/).

New to DSH profiles, plugin composition, tool policy, or session semantics? The
independent [DeepSeek Harness Handbook](https://github.com/sandbaseai/deepseek-harness-handbook)
provides source-backed quickstarts, architecture maps, and troubleshooting for
the runtime layers used by this integration. Start with the local-browser
[Install Doctor](https://sandbaseai.github.io/deepseek-harness-handbook/install-doctor.html)
for installation evidence, or use the
[Failure Router](https://sandbaseai.github.io/deepseek-harness-handbook/diagnose.html)
to identify the first broken runtime boundary.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --branch v0.3.8 --depth 1 https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness.git
cd sandbase-harness
npm ci
npm run build
mkdir ../my-agents && cd ../my-agents
node ../sandbase-harness/dist/index.js init
node ../sandbase-harness/dist/index.js start
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:3000/dashboard`, go to **Settings > Models**, paste your
API key, and you're running.

The unscoped `managed-agents` name on npm is not this project. Until an
official scoped package is announced in this repository, install only from the
tagged GitHub source release shown above. Do not run `npx managed-agents` or
`npm install managed-agents`.

The six-tool MCP bridge is published as a multi-architecture OCI image. Start
the Harness API, then add this stdio command to an MCP client:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness-mcp:0.3.8
docker run --rm -i \
  -e MANAGED_AGENTS_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000 \
  ghcr.io/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness-mcp:0.3.8
```

For an authenticated remote runtime, also pass `MANAGED_AGENTS_API_KEY`. The
container image contains only the MCP bridge; agent sessions and sandbox work
remain in the connected Harness runtime. Every release image is built from the
matching Git tag for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, includes OCI source and
MCP ownership metadata, and receives a GitHub build-provenance attestation.

### Portable Agent Plugin

Copilot CLI, VS Code, and other Agent Plugins 1.0 clients can install the same
OCI-backed MCP bridge directly from this repository. Start the Harness API and
Docker first, then expose its URL to the plugin process:

```bash
export MANAGED_AGENTS_URL=http://host.docker.internal:3000
# Optional when the runtime requires authentication:
export MANAGED_AGENTS_API_KEY=your-runtime-key

copilot plugin install sandbaseai/sandbase-harness:agent-plugin
```

The plugin passes these environment variables through to the pinned
`ghcr.io/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness-mcp:0.3.8` image. It does not store a key
in `plugin.json`, `mcp.json`, or the installed plugin files. On Linux, the
plugin's Docker command maps `host.docker.internal` through `host-gateway`.

For development from the latest `main` branch:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness.git
cd sandbase-harness && npm ci && npm run build
cd .. && mkdir my-agents-dev && cd my-agents-dev
node ../sandbase-harness/dist/index.js init
node ../sandbase-harness/dist/index.js start
```

    └── sandbox/             # Local session sandboxes
```

## Configuration

`.managed-agents/config.yaml`:

```yaml
model:
  provider: openai
  api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}

storage:
  metadata: { provider: sqlite, options: {} }
  artifacts: { provider: local, options: { base_path: files } }
```

Agents pick concrete model IDs (`gpt-4o`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`,
`openai/gpt-5.5`). The workspace config only says how to reach the model
service.

For DeepSeek V4 Pro/Flash configuration, including maximum reasoning effort,
see [DeepSeek V4](docs/deepseek-v4.md).

For first-class MiniMax configuration, regional endpoints, and the supported
MiniMax-M3 and MiniMax-M2.7 model IDs, see [MiniMax](docs/minimax.md).

## CLI

```bash
managed-agents init
managed-agents start [--host 127.0.0.1] [--port 3000]
managed-agents list
managed-agents reload
managed-agents chat <agent-id> --message "hello"
managed-agents template list | install <name> | create <name>
```

## API Examples

Create an agent:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/agents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Incident commander",
    "model": "gpt-4o",
    "system": "You are an on-call incident commander.",
    "tools": [{ "type": "agent_toolset_20260401" }]
  }'
```

Create an environment (local sandbox):

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/environments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Default local",
    "config": { "hosting_type": "local", "sandbox_provider": "local" }
  }'
```

Create a Docker-isolated environment:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/environments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Docker sandbox",
    "config": {
      "sandbox_provider": "docker",
      "image": "node:22-slim",
      "resources": { "memory": "1g", "cpu": 1 }
    }
  }'
```

Start a session:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/sessions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent": "agent_...",
    "environment_id": "env_...",
    "title": "Triage SENTRY-123"
  }'
```

Send a message:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/sessions/SESSION_ID/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "content": "Investigate the alert." }'
```

Resume the event stream:

```bash
curl -N http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/sessions/SESSION_ID/events/stream \
  -H "Last-Event-ID: 42"
```

## SDK

```typescript
import { ManagedAgentsClient } from 'managed-agents/sdk';

const client = new ManagedAgentsClient({
  baseUrl: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
});

const session = await client.sessions.create({
  agent: 'agent_...',
  environment_id: 'env_...',
});

for await (const event of client.sessions.chat(session.id, 'Hello')) {
  if (event.type === 'agent.message_chunk') {
    process.stdout.write(event.delta ?? '');
  }
}
```

The `/v1` API follows Claude Managed Agents resource shapes, so you can also
point the Anthropic SDK at the local runtime:

```typescript
import Anthropic from '@anthropic-ai/sdk';

const client = new Anthropic({
  apiKey: process.env.MANAGED_AGENTS_API_KEY ?? 'local-dev-key',
  baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',
});

const session = await client.beta.sessions.create({
  agent: 'agent_...',
  environment_id: 'env_...',
});
```

## Authentication

Open by default. Authentication activates when at least one API key exists:

```bash
# Static key via environment
export MANAGED_AGENTS_API_KEY=sk-local-example

# Or create a managed key
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3000/v1/api-keys \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "name": "Local Console" }'
```

Clients send `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.

## Agent Definition

Agents are YAML files in `agents/`:

```yaml
name: Incident commander
description: Triages alerts and coordinates response.
model: gpt-4o
system: |-
  You are an on-call incident commander.
mcp_servers:
  - name: sentry
    type: url
    url: https://mcp.sentry.dev/mcp
tools:
  - type: agent_toolset_20260401
    default_config:
      permission_policy: { type: always_ask }
    configs:
      - name: bash
        permission_policy: { type: always_ask }
  - type: mcp_toolset
    mcp_server_name: sentry
skills:
  - type: custom
    skill_id: skill_...
metadata:
  template: incident-commander
```

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run typecheck    # src + tests
npm test             # vitest
npm run build        # runtime + console + SDK
npm run release:check  # full local release gate
```

`release:check` runs typecheck, tests, both builds, `npm pack --dry-run`, CLI
init smoke, and `examples/basic` startup smoke.
