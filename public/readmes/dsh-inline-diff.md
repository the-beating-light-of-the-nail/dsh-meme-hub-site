# dsh-inline-diff

English | [简体中文](README.zh.md)

See every file your agent edits, right in the chat. No clicking required.

By default the DeepSeek Harness web GUI collapses each file edit into a tiny one-line row. This plugin replaces those rows with an always-open, side-by-side diff: old code on the left, new code on the right, additions in green, deletions in red, a colored edge bar on every changed row, a hover highlight that tracks the row under your cursor, and a `+N −N` summary for every file.

## What it looks like

A typical edit: changed lines paired side by side, with the exact words that changed highlighted:

## Words or whole lines

By default a changed line gets double highlighting: the row is tinted green/red, and on top of that the exact words that changed get a stronger highlight. Prefer it calmer? Open **Settings → Plugins → Inline diff** and pick *Lines only*. You keep the row tint but lose the word chips. The choice is saved in your DSH settings and survives restarts.

## Indentation

Edits often arrive indented with their surrounding code, which pushes the actual change toward the middle of the card. By default the diff strips the leading whitespace every non-empty line shares, so changes sit closer to the gutter; a small `⇤ N` badge on the file header shows how many characters were removed. Prefer seeing the code as written? Pick *Keep* under **Settings → Plugins → Inline diff** and the original indentation stays. Like the highlighting choice, this is saved and survives restarts.

## Syntax highlighting

Code rows are colored by a bundled highlight.js (the same language set the Solution Explorer sidebar uses), so edits read like an editor: keywords in your accent color, strings green, comments muted, and so on. The tokens read the same `--shiki-token-*` variables your GUI's code blocks render with, and the language is detected from the file's extension; unknown extensions stay plain. Prefer plain text? Pick *Off* under **Settings → Plugins → Inline diff → Syntax highlighting**. Like the other choices, this is saved and survives restarts.

[dsh-stylevault](https://github.com/GptsApp/dsh-stylevault) compatible: its Colors panel overrides exactly those `--shiki-token-*` variables, so restyling your theme there restyles the diff cards too.

## Themes

Every color on the card, from surfaces and text to borders and the green/red diff tints, is derived from your GUI's theme tokens (Settings → Appearance). The card follows light mode, dark mode, and any custom accent colors instead of a fixed palette. The syntax token colors ride the same system (the GUI's shiki code palette); before any theme variables exist they simply render as the card's plain text color.

The same compact edit under a custom theme — [dsh-stylevault](https://github.com/GptsApp/dsh-stylevault) overrides exactly those token variables, so a restyle there restyles every diff card:

## Language

The settings card comes with English and Simplified Chinese text. It follows the GUI language picked under **Settings → General → Language**; when nothing is stored it follows your browser. A missing translation falls back to English.

## Install

**With the `dsh` CLI** (easiest):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:JanEickholt/dsh-inline-diff
```

**From GitHub** (manual, same result):

1. Add the plugin to your profile's `package.json`:

   ```json
   "dsh-inline-diff": "github:JanEickholt/dsh-inline-diff"
   ```

   then run `pnpm install` in the profile directory.

2. Add it to your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

   ```yaml
   - insert:
       - id: inline-diff
         name: 'dsh-inline-diff'
   ```

3. Refresh the GUI page. Done. Every edit and file write now renders as an inline diff.

**Manual**: copy this repository into `<profile>/node_modules/dsh-inline-diff/` and add the same patch row.
