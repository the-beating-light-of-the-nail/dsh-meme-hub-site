# dsh-usage-meter-harness

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A real-time usage / cost / balance meter plugin for **DeepSeek Harness (DSH)**.
See tokens, spending and real wallet balance right next to the chat input — for
the official DeepSeek models **and** any custom model registered in DSH.

## Install

> Prerequisite (methods 1 & 2): the DSH CLI itself runs on pnpm — install it once per machine:
> `npm install -g pnpm` (or `corepack enable`), then verify with `pnpm --version`.

Pick one of the three methods. **Methods 1 and 2 need pnpm** (a one-time machine
setup used by the DSH CLI itself): `npm install -g pnpm` or `corepack enable`.

### Method 1 — npm registry via DSH CLI (needs pnpm)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add --verbose @faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness@latest
```

(`--verbose` shows the install progress; drop it if you prefer a quiet install.
`@latest` explicitly requests the newest release — always install this way.)

### Method 2 — GitHub via DSH CLI (needs pnpm)

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add --verbose github:faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness
```

(`--verbose` shows the install progress.)

### Method 3 — one-line installer, no pnpm (recommended)

```bash
npx -y @faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness@latest
```
One command: installs into the DSH web profile and registers the bundle (idempotent).
(`@latest` explicitly requests the newest release — always install this way.)

Prefer not to use npx? The same logic ships as scripts in the repo:

Windows (cmd):

```bat
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness/main/scripts/install.cmd -o "%TEMP%\um-install.cmd" && "%TEMP%\um-install.cmd"
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

The script does everything for you: `cd` into the DSH web profile, installs the
package with visible progress, and registers the bundle in `dsh.profile.bundles`
(idempotent — safe to re-run after upgrades).

> Note: Method 3 uses plain `npm` and does **not** do pnpm coordination. If your
> profile is managed with pnpm (the default for `dsh plugin`), prefer Method 1.

After any method: **restart `dsh web`**.

## Updating

Two cases — pick the right one:

**Fresh install (never had the plugin), or the `npx` method:** just run the
install command; it always fetches the latest release.

**Upgrading an existing install (plugin already present):** the profile's
`package.json` / `pnpm-lock.yaml` may be pinned to an old version, and a bare
`add` can be skipped by pnpm as "already satisfied". **Always ask for the new
version explicitly:**

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness@latest
```

or, from inside the profile directory (`~/.dsh/profiles/web`):

```bash
pnpm update @faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness
```

(You may also pin an exact version, e.g. `...@1.0.28`.)

**If your `package.json` binds the plugin via a `file:` path or a pin that `add`
won't override** (you see `Already up to date` / `downloaded 0`), use the
one-line installer instead — it always requests `@latest`, which rewrites the
binding to `^<latest>` and upgrades in a single command:

```bash
npx -y @faith1688/dsh-usage-meter-harness@latest
```

(Re-running this same command is the permanent update path: it is idempotent
and upgrades regardless of whether you currently bind via `file:`, a pin, or `^`.)

After updating: **restart `dsh web`** (or reload the browser page). Note that
restarting alone never fetches a new version — it only reloads what is already
in `node_modules`.

**Why this never duplicates the mount entry and never touches your config:**

- The mount entry lives **inside the package** (`cordis.patch.yml`, the
  `dsh.bundle` mechanism). Every release ships its own complete entry; DSH reads
  it from the installed package at startup — installing a newer package
  automatically brings the correct entry with it.
- Installers only edit the profile's `package.json` (`dsh.profile.bundles`,
  de-duplicated) and `node_modules`. They **never write** the profile-root
  `cordis.patch.yml`, so anything you added there yourself (or your other plugin
  configs) stays untouched.
- A duplicate mount entry can only happen if you manually added the same `id` to
  the profile-root `cordis.patch.yml` yourself — the installers never do that.

## Features

### Conversation usage card (next to the chat input)

| Cache hit rate | Share of cached tokens for the session |
| Account balance | Real DeepSeek wallet balance; local-ledger estimate for other providers |
| Budget & remaining | Set a budget, see used / remaining / over-budget |

### Billing engine

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 6 billing templates | Basic · Cache hit/miss · Peak/off-peak (DeepSeek official hours) · Cache write+hit · Combined input+output · Batch half price |
| Custom price rows | Up to 4 user-defined rows; the popup mirrors your setup verbatim |
| Peak/off-peak billing | Beijing-time weekday + hour windows, cross-midnight supported; each request is billed by its start time |
| Per-model pricing | Currency (CNY/USD), unit prices and balance per model |
| Shared provider wallet | One balance shared by all models of a provider — single checkbox |
| Official price prefill | DeepSeek official models come pre-filled with official prices and the official peak schedule |
| Built-in price table | 137 models across 19 vendors bundled; optional LiteLLM-shaped remote price source |

| Legacy migration | Old manual initial-balance/top-up settings migrate into provider wallets automatically |

### Settings & UX

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bilingual UI | 中文 / English switch at the top-right of the settings page; applies everywhere instantly (popup included). Display only — saved data never changes |
| In-use lock | While a model is generating, its editor is locked so a running turn keeps consistent prices |
| WYSIWYG popup | Usage-card rows are copied verbatim from your template selection |
| Non-intrusive | Standard DSH cordis plugin; touches no other plugin and no DSH core files |

## Supported models

- **DeepSeek official models** (`deepseek-chat`, `deepseek-reasoner`, …): official
  prices pre-filled; real wallet balance via API Key.
- **Any custom model** registered in DSH (OpenAI-compatible providers, Ollama,
  OpenRouter, …): set unit prices and balance yourself; everything else works the same.

## Configuration

All settings live in the `usage-meter` settings namespace and can be edited
directly in the plugin UI:

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `currency` | string | `CNY` | Display currency |
| `budget` | number | – | Session budget; shows "remaining" when set |
| `priceSourceUrl` | string | – | LiteLLM-shaped price JSON URL; optional |
| `refreshIntervalMs` | number | 4 h | Price / balance / rate refresh interval |
| `deepseekApiKey` | secret | – | Only used to query the DeepSeek balance (stored AES-encrypted; never read from the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` env var) |

## Compatibility

- Node.js ≥ 22.
- Peer versions track the supported DSH releases (see `package.json`); updating
  DSH does not break the plugin, and it never modifies your other plugins.

## Privacy

- The plugin makes **no telemetry and no analytics calls**.
- Network requests are limited to two optional ones: querying the **official
  DeepSeek balance API** with the API key you configure yourself, and fetching a
  public USD→CNY exchange rate. Nothing else leaves your machine.
- The source is MIT-licensed and fully readable on GitHub.
