A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) Web
plugin that adds a **QR-code button above the Settings button** in the sidebar
footer. It runs a small auth-gated reverse proxy so a phone on the same network
(or the internet) can scan a QR code and open the web UI securely. It is a
persistent bundle plugin (a host half plus a browser half) that loads on every
boot.

## What it does

- Adds a full-width button (`sidebar.footer.action`, id `qr-connect`) stacked
  **above** the shipped Plugins button.
- Opens a fading panel with **two** QR codes:
  - **Local network** — `http://<lan-ip>:<port>/?auth=<secret>`.
  - **Public internet** — `http://<public-ip>:<port>/?auth=<secret>` (blue).
- The reverse proxy (a child `node` process on `0.0.0.0:<port>`) validates the
  secret, issues a session cookie (default 30 days), and forwards to the
  loopback web UI — including WebSocket upgrades so live updates reach the phone.
- The secret rotates every 30s by default and the QR refreshes to match
  (configurable; `0` disables auto-refresh).
- Click a QR to copy its link; the public QR has an info tooltip.
- A **QR connect** card under Settings → Plugins configures the proxy port,
  session length, and refresh interval.
- English and Chinese UI via DSH's locale service.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `lib/index.js` | Host half — runs the reverse proxy and the `/__qr/*` state routes. |
| `lib/client.js` | Browser half — the QR button and the settings card. |
| `lib/proxy.cjs` | The auth-gated reverse proxy child process (HTTP + WebSocket). |
| `cordis.patch.yml` | Composition patch that inserts the plugin row. |
| `package.json` | Package metadata (`dsh.bundle` + `dsh.client` manifest). |

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:mervyn-teo/dsh-plugin-qr-connect
```

Then restart `dsh web` — host bundles load at boot.

Defaults live in `cordis.patch.yml` (`port`, `sessionDays`, `refreshSeconds`,
`publicHost`). Change them there (or in the profile's own `cordis.patch.yml`)
and restart, or adjust them from the settings card — edits are written to the
`qr-connect` settings namespace's user layer, so they survive restarts and
layer over the composition defaults. `publicHost` is a custom domain or IP
used for the public-internet QR code instead of the auto-detected public IP
(accepts `host`, `host:port`, or a full `https://` origin; empty = auto-detect). The host half serves three same-origin routes the
browser half uses: `GET /__qr/info`, `POST /__qr/rotate`, and
`GET|POST /__qr/config`.

## Requirements

- DSH with the `subprocess`, `fs`, and `webServer` services mounted, plus the
  `settings` service for the Settings → Plugins card (without it the card is
  hidden and edits stay runtime-only).
- Internet access from the DSH host for the public-IP lookup
  (`https://api.ipify.org`).
- The scanning device must be able to reach the proxy port (a host firewall may
  need an allow rule); the public QR also needs internet reachability
  (port-forwarding).

Local-IP and public-IP detection run in-process (no `ip`/`curl`/shell commands),
and manual secret rotation signals the proxy child over its stdin, so the host
half works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Security

The proxy exposes the full agent shell to anyone who can reach the port, gated
only by the 30s secret and the session cookie. Use a short session length and
treat this as a trusted-network convenience, not a hardened remote-access layer.
