## What it is

A **DeepSeek Harness (DSH) WebUI** plugin for controlling **skills, MCP servers, tools, prompt injections, approval escalation, and safety guards** at session, project, or global scope. Depending on the family, disabling removes, suppresses, rejects, or intercepts the capability on the agent's next step.

## Compatible DSH versions

One build serves the whole 0.1.x line. The composer slot's owner share changed at
DSH 0.1.2 — the `session` snapshot object was dropped in favor of the framework's
`sessionId` prop and `useSession` hook — and this plugin reads both shapes.

| DSH version | Status | How it was checked |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0.1.1-rc.2 | supported | unit tests, typecheck, build, and a real browser session (panel rendered, toggles written) |
| 0.1.2-rc.1 | supported | unit tests, typecheck (Host and Client faces), and a load check against an installed 0.1.2 host; the browser run above was on 0.1.1 only |
| 0.1.3-alpha.1 / -alpha.2 | supported | every DSH symbol this plugin consumes was diffed from 0.1.2-rc.1 to current HEAD and is unchanged; not built or run against an installed 0.1.3 host |

The declared `peerDependencies` admit all of the above, including the prereleases
npm publishes as `next` (0.1.2-rc.1) and `alpha` (0.1.3-alpha.x), and reject
0.2.0 and later.

## Quick start

Requires **Node.js ≥ 22.6**.

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:lifeopsgo/dsh-capability-toggle-plugin#v1.3.0
```

Restart the existing DSH Web GUI process, then refresh the page. Start it with the command below when it is stopped:

```bash
dsh --profile web web
```

Open the control beside the ➕ button while the agent is idle. Replace `web` with another profile name when needed.

# Upgrade or downgrade: use any tag listed on the releases page
dsh plugin --profile web add github:lifeopsgo/dsh-capability-toggle-plugin#v1.3.0

# Remove
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-capability-toggle-plugin
```

## Features

### Three-level resolution

Each capability has three independent levels:

```text
session  ›  project  ›  global  ›  default (enabled)
```

The nearest explicit value wins. **Unset** defers to the next level; with every level unset, the capability remains enabled. The row badge always shows the resolved result.

The button displays only its current state: click to toggle **on ↔ off**, or use its small clear badge to return to **unset**.

### Capability families

| Tab | Controls |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Skills** | Individual model-invocable skills, including project-level skills discovered from the session's workspace (`.dsh/skills`, `.agents/skills`) |
| **MCP** | MCP servers; expand a row to inspect member tools |
| **Tools** | Individual model-visible tools and their guidance sections |
| **Prompt** | A safe, presence-checked allowlist of prompt injections |
| **Security** | Approval escalation and five opt-in safety guards |

### Enforcement

Every mechanism is scoped to the current agent; global registrations are not mutated.

| Family | Enforcement |
| :-- | :-- |
| `tool` / `mcp` | Removed with `ctx.tools.restrict({ deny })`; forced calls are refused |
| `skill` | Shadowed by a same-named `modelInvocable:false` runtime skill |
| `prompt` | Shadowed with empty text, or suppressed with `suppressRuntimeContext()` |
| `approval` | Scoped approval requests resolve to `rejected` |
| `guard` | `tools/pre-execute` blocks or requests confirmation for matching calls |

### Security controls

Turning off **Approval escalation** rejects every approval request from that agent without changing the system `/permission` setting.

Safety guards are opt-in:

| Guard | Action |
| :-- | :-- |
| Read-only mode | Block file writes, creates, and edits |
| Protect secrets | Block access to common secret files and credentials |
| Dangerous shell | Confirm high-risk shell commands |
| Destructive git | Confirm history- or work-losing git commands |
| Outbound network | Confirm network tools and outbound shell actions |

### Usage stats

Skills, MCP servers, and tools carry a small badge showing how many times the model called them this session (`called 7`). Counts update when a turn ends while the panel is open, live for one agent's lifetime, and are never persisted — the same retention as a safety guard's `matched N` badge.

The tally counts **requests**, not successful runs: a call a guard blocked or sent to confirmation still counts, because the model asking for a capability is the signal worth seeing. Guards are matched against rather than called, so they keep their own badge and show no usage count; prompt and approval rows show none either.

### Panel preferences

A disclosure arrow beside the panel title opens three display preferences, stored in `localStorage` so they survive page reloads and restarts:

| Preference | Effect |
| :-- | :-- |
| **Show “enabled / total” on tabs** | Renders each tab badge as a fraction (`67/106`) instead of a bare total, so the strip reports how much of each family is active at a glance. The tooltip states both numbers in words either way. |
| **Show call stats** | Hides or shows the per-row usage badge described above. |
| **Level columns to show** | Narrows the grid to Session, Session + Project, or all three columns. |

The fraction counts a guard as enabled only while it is **active**. A guard row reuses the same `disabled` field to mean ACTIVE — the inverse of every default-on family — so a Security tab with the approval gate open and all five guards inactive reads `1/6`, not `6/6`.

Narrowing the level columns is **display-only**: the three-level resolution keeps running exactly as before, so a hidden project or global override still applies. Each row's badge and level switches always reflect the resolved state — a default-on family reads `Active`/`Disabled`, a guard reads `Guarding`/`Inactive` — which is why hiding a column cannot hide an effect. The name column absorbs the freed width, and the layout is driven by CSS variables so it stays aligned with the narrow-screen adaptation.

Additional behavior: switches lock while the agent runs, state survives popup close and turn boundaries, and the UI follows the WebUI language.

## Roadmap

Planned, not yet implemented:

- **Cross-project config sync** — copy or link project-level settings from another project instead of configuring each project from scratch.
- ~~**Capability invocation stats**~~ — shipped in v1.2.0: skills, MCP servers, and tools badge how many times the model called them this session.
- ~~**Fraction-format tab counts**~~ — shipped in v1.3.0: each tab badge renders as `enabled / total`, and the panel's disclosure arrow holds three display preferences. A guard counts as enabled only while active, so its inverted `disabled` flag never inflates the Security numerator.
- **Settings menu for customizable defaults** — expose the plugin's own options in a settings menu, such as the default stance for newly discovered capabilities (today a capability with all three levels unset resolves to enabled, except the opt-in safety guards, which stay inactive).
- **Show only enabled / only disabled** — add a state filter next to the search box, which today matches names and descriptions only. Guards need the same care the fraction counts need: a guard reuses `disabled` to mean ACTIVE, so "only disabled" must not list a guard that is actually enforcing. The filter would also narrow what bulk actions apply to, since they act on every currently visible row.
- ~~**Filter and select-all**~~ — shipped in v1.1.0: the toolbar's search box filters rows, and each level's bulk menu applies enable/disable/clear to every currently visible row.
- ~~**Bulk actions on a filtered selection**~~ — shipped in v1.1.0 together with the filter (search narrows, bulk acts on what's shown).
