# dsh-edit-approval

Per-edit approval for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): **every `write` / `edit` / `str_replace_editor` call asks before the file is touched** — a red/green line-level diff, then **approve once or reject**; master switch in Settings → General.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-write approval | Intercepts `write` / `edit` / `str_replace_editor` on the `tools/pre-execute` seam and asks before any file is modified |
| Red/green line diff | Line-level diff (added / removed / context) computed per tool semantics; the approval panel shows only the changed lines — a right-aligned line-number gutter with `|` (`   15| +XI-EDITED`) — and a `…` ellipsis marks skipped context runs and hunk gaps |
| Panel collapse | Long diffs can be collapsed via the button at the strip's right end to reveal the agent's output; CSS-only hide/show, expanding restores the exact view |
| Approve once / reject | Two actions, mirroring the Claude Code edit-approval flow; rejection reports back to the model |
| Master switch | Settings → General "Edit approval" row, backed by the `/approval-edit on\|off\|status` host command (same source) |
| Policy-aware | Respects the session approval policy: `ask` intercepts, `never` (full access) runs edits through untouched |
| Thresholds | `minDiffLines`, `includeCreate`, `includeDelete` for fine-grained control |

## 📦 Install

Published to npm — the registry path is the recommended one. **Restart dsh web (`--profile web`) after installing.**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-edit-approval
```

For contributors: local checkout (`dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-edit-approval`), a pinned GitHub commit (`dsh plugin --profile web add github:SiriLee/dsh-edit-approval#<sha>`), or an offline tarball (`npm pack` then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-edit-approval-<version>.tgz`). A git install fails on first run until you add an `allowBuilds` key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm blocks git dependencies from running build scripts); after that it runs the plugin's `prepare` and installs it. `npm pack` also runs `prepare`, so a tarball always carries a prebuilt `lib/` (with `.d.ts`) and the `LICENSE`.

## How it works

The plugin listens on the `tools/pre-execute` waterfall (the seam the harness
runs before a tool executes) and matches a whitelist of registered tool names:
`write`, `edit`, `str_replace_editor`. For each intercepted call it:

1. **Resolves the target** through `ctx.fs`, applying the same session-cwd rule
   the fs tools use (a relative `..` path canonicalizes the cwd).
2. **Reads the current content** and reconstructs the proposed content from the
   tool's arguments, mirroring each tool's semantics:
   - `write` — full text; `edit` — single unique replace (or `replace_all`);
   - `str_replace_editor` — `str_replace` unique replace, `insert` line
     insertion, `create` uses `file_text`.
3. **Computes a line-level diff** between current and proposed content with
   jsdiff's `structuredPatch` (Myers), the same reference implementation and
   the same 3-line context window the harness's write/edit result cards use —
   so the approval preview and the post-approval result card derive from the
   same algorithm, and a one-line edit in a large file stays a one-line diff.
4. **Returns `{ kind: 'ask', reason }`** with a header line (`tool · file
   (op): N insertions, M deletions`) plus the diff text — change rows with
   a right-aligned line-number gutter and `|` (`   15| -xi` /
   `   15| +XI-EDITED`), plus context rows and `⋯` hunk gaps carried on the
   same structuredPatch source as the harness result cards. The harness's
   own `serviceAsk` routes that through `ctx.approval` into the web approval
   panel — the host needs **zero UI changes**. `allowed-once` proceeds,
   `rejected` denies the call; every other case delegates via `next()`.

The browser half (`dsh.client`) rebuilds the panel's plain-text headline into
only the changed rows — removals red, additions green, with the right-aligned
`NN|` gutter — and a `…` ellipsis marks skipped context runs and hunk gaps;
it adds a `white-space: pre-wrap` compensation for the headline's CSS,
installs the collapse button on multi-line diffs, and registers the
Settings → General master-switch row. All side effects live in a single
`ctx.effect` (torn down on plugin unload / HMR), and a per-animation-frame
`MutationObserver` enhances approval panels as they appear.

## Approval policy interaction

The harness's session approval policy (`ask` / `never`) keeps applying:

| Session policy | Plugin behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `ask` (e.g. `workspace-write` preset) | Intercepts and shows the approval panel |
| `never` (e.g. `danger-full-access` preset) | Delegates — edits run without prompting, the sandbox keeps enforcing |

Under `never`, every `ask` this plugin emitted would be deterministically
rejected by the approval service, silently breaking every edit in a full-access
session. The plugin therefore stops asking and lets the sandbox enforce. It
never expands access or changes the sandbox mode.

## Configure

Runtime configuration lives in the `edit-approval` settings namespace, layered
as **schema defaults < cordis row config < user settings page (persisted)**.
The cordis row ships without config on purpose; a profile patch overrides
deployment defaults by restating only the keys it changes:

```yaml
# profile's cordis.patch.yml
- id: dsh-edit-approval
  name: dsh-edit-approval
  config:
    minDiffLines: 2
    includeCreate: false
```

| Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch (users can turn it off) |
| `tools` | `['write','edit','str_replace_editor']` | Whitelist of intercepted registered tool names |
| `minDiffLines` | `0` | Ask only when the change touches **at least** this many lines; smaller changes pass silently |
| `includeCreate` | `true` | Whether creating a new file asks for approval |
| `includeDelete` | `true` | Whether clearing/emptying a file asks for approval |

## Behavior details & limitations

- Only write-family **tools** are intercepted; edits inside `bash`/`pwsh`
  commands are out of scope.
- The diff is presented as `+` / `-` line markers — a read-only preview, not
  interactive per-line selection; "apply partially" is not supported.
- Cases the tool itself would fail on are **not** asked about and pass through
  for the tool to report: `str_replace_editor create` against an existing file,
  a non-unique or missing `old_str` / `old_string`. An empty `old_string` `edit`
  preview deviates from the tool (treated as not-found) — the deviation is safe,
  it never falsely blocks.
- The button text follows `navigator.language`, not `ctx.locale` — a deliberate
  simplification for a self-contained bundle.
- Note the registered tool name is `str_replace_editor` (underscores), distinct
  from the npm package name `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-str-replace-editor`.

## Not included

- Post-edit review / rollback — covered by the community
  [dsh-change-review](https://github.com/cirelir/dsh-change-review).
- Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to approve / Esc to reject) — split into a
  dedicated plugin.
- Permission-tier extensions — covered by the community
  [dsh-auto-approval-plugin](https://github.com/StyxNether/dsh-auto-approval-plugin).

## Compatibility

- Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`.
- DeepSeek Harness web profile (`dsh --profile web`); peer `@deepseek-ai/*`
  packages are resolved by the harness at runtime.

## Development

```sh
npm install            # devDeps from the npm registry
npm run typecheck      # tsc on both compilation surfaces (host + client)
npm test               # vitest: diff / guard unit tests + real-cordis integration + jsdom panel-collapse (54 cases)
npm run build          # full build: tsc → lib/ (with .d.ts) + lib/client.js bundle
npm run build:portable # optional lightweight esbuild build, no typecheck
node scripts/verify-host.mjs   # verify the BUILT host artifact end-to-end
```

`prepare` runs the full build, so git installs and `npm pack`/`npm publish`
always produce a complete `lib/` (with `.d.ts`) and the `LICENSE`.

## Publishing

Releases go out through GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no stored
`NPM_TOKEN`). See [docs/npm-trusted-publishing-guide.md](docs/npm-trusted-publishing-guide.md).

```sh
npm version patch && git push origin main --tags   # triggers .github/workflows/publish.yml
```

The workflow verifies the tag matches `package.json`, runs typecheck + tests +
a full build + artifact verification, publishes with Sigstore provenance, and
creates a GitHub Release. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same checks
on every push / PR. The publish step is idempotent — a version already on npm
is skipped.

## Directory layout

```

src/diff.ts             line-level diff (pure functions: jsdiff structuredPatch mapping, render, counts)
src/guard.ts            decision logic (pure functions: tool matching, thresholds, create/delete, ask/pass)
src/client/index.ts     client plugin: red/green diff rendering + master switch + lifecycle
src/client/settings-row.tsx   Settings → General toggle row
tests/                  vitest suites (diff / guard / integration / client collapse)

package.json            dsh.bundle + dsh.client manifests, peerDependencies
```

## Security

This plugin reads the target file only to compute the preview diff (at the `tools/pre-execute` interception point); it never writes files itself — the tool body performs the write only after you approve. It makes no network requests and accesses no credentials.
