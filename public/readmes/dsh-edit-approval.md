# dsh-edit-approval

Ask-before-act approval for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): **every `write` / `edit` / `str_replace_editor` call asks before the file is touched — a red/green line-level diff, approve once or reject — and every `bash` command asks before it runs**, each with its own master switch in Settings → General.

> English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A deliberately focused plugin with **two mirror-symmetric approval gates** — edits and commands — so the agent can never modify files or run commands without your say-so.

| Gate | Intercepts | Default | Panel |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Edit approval** | `write` / `edit` / `str_replace_editor` | On | Red/green line-level diff — approve once or reject |
| **Bash approval** | `bash` | Off | Description headline + native command row |

Both gates ride the harness's own `serviceAsk` seam: the plugin returns `{ kind: 'ask', reason }` from `tools/pre-execute`, the harness routes it into the web approval panel — **zero UI changes in the host** — `allowed-once` proceeds, `rejected` denies the call, and under the `never` policy the plugin delegates so full-access sessions keep working.

## Preview

After installing, Settings → General gains two rows — **编辑审批 / 命令审批** (Edit approval / Bash approval). Every write-family call shows the red/green diff panel; after you enable Bash approval, every command shows a panel whose white headline is the agent's description and whose grey row is the raw command text.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-edit-approval
```

Restart `dsh web` (`--profile web`) after installing.

For contributors: install from a local checkout or a pinned commit — `dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-edit-approval` or `dsh plugin --profile web add github:SiriLee/dsh-edit-approval#<sha>` — or from an offline tarball (`npm pack` then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-edit-approval-<version>.tgz`). A git install fails on first run until you add an `allowBuilds` key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm blocks git dependencies from running build scripts); after that it runs the plugin's `prepare` and installs it. `npm pack` also runs `prepare`, so a tarball always carries a prebuilt `lib/` (with `.d.ts`) and the `LICENSE`.

## Usage

1. **Edit approval is on by default.** Any `write` / `edit` / `str_replace_editor` call asks before the file is touched. The panel shows only the changed lines — removals red, additions green — with a right-aligned `NN|` line-number gutter and a `…` ellipsis marking skipped context and hunk gaps.
2. **Approve once or reject.** `allowed-once` lets the call proceed; `rejected` denies it and reports back to the model.
3. **Bash approval is off by default** — enable it in Settings → General or with the command below. The panel's white headline is the description (e.g. `bash · push to remote`); the grey row below is the raw command text, rendered natively by the harness.
4. **Command-line entry:** `/approval-edit on|off|status` and `/approval-bash on|off|status` — the same source as the settings rows.
5. **Allow-list (config file):** in the `bash-approval` settings namespace, `allow` holds command prefixes that always pass. Matching is whitespace-normalized (`git  push` hits `git push`) so a bypass via extra spaces fails. There is deliberately no UI for it yet.

## How it works

The plugin listens on the `tools/pre-execute` waterfall (the seam the harness runs before a tool executes) and dispatches to one of two gates by tool name — edits win on overlap.

### 1. Edit approval

For each intercepted write-family call it:

1. **Resolves the target** through `ctx.fs`, applying the same session-cwd rule the fs tools use (a relative `..` path canonicalizes the cwd).
2. **Reads the current content** and reconstructs the proposed content from the tool's arguments, mirroring each tool's semantics: `write` — full text; `edit` — single unique replace (or `replace_all`); `str_replace_editor` — `str_replace` unique replace, `insert` line insertion, `create` uses `file_text`.
3. **Computes a line-level diff** with jsdiff's `structuredPatch` (Myers) — the same reference implementation and the same 3-line context window the harness's write/edit result cards use — so the approval preview and the post-approval result card derive from the same algorithm, and a one-line edit in a large file stays a one-line diff.
4. **Returns `{ kind: 'ask', reason }`** with a header line (`tool · file (op): N insertions, M deletions`) plus the diff text. The harness's `serviceAsk` routes it through `ctx.approval` into the web approval panel.

### 2. Bash approval

A pure decision, **no fs involved** — it never reads or writes anything:

- Passes when the gate is disabled, the tool is not in `tools`, the command is blank, or the call is a **sandbox escalation** (`sandbox_permissions` + `justification` — those carry their own approval and must not double-prompt).
- **Allow-list first**: a whitespace-normalized prefix match passes without asking.
- Otherwise returns `{ kind: 'ask', reason }` with a single-line headline — `bash · <description>` (or just `bash` when the description is blank). The command text is **not** embedded in the reason: the harness renders it natively in the panel's command row, so nothing is duplicated.

### 3. Shared policy handling

The session approval policy (`ask` / `never`) keeps applying. Under `never` (e.g. `danger-full-access`), every `ask` this plugin emits would be deterministically rejected by the approval service, silently breaking every edit and command in a full-access session — so both gates delegate via `next()` and let the sandbox enforce. The plugin never expands access or changes the sandbox mode.

### 4. The approval panel

The browser half (`dsh.client`) enhances panels as they appear (a per-animation-frame `MutationObserver`, all side effects inside a single `ctx.effect` torn down on unload / HMR):

- **Edit panels** are rebuilt from the plain-text headline into only the changed rows — removals red, additions green, right-aligned `NN|` gutter — plus a `white-space: pre-wrap` compensation and a collapse button on multi-line diffs.
- **Bash panels** are left harness-native: a `dsh-ea-kind-command` marker only, no restyling, no rebuild — the white description headline and grey command row are exactly what the harness renders.

## Configuration

Runtime configuration lives in two settings namespaces — `edit-approval` and `bash-approval` — layered as **schema defaults < cordis row config < user settings page (persisted)**. The cordis row ships without config on purpose; a profile patch overrides deployment defaults by restating only the keys it changes:

```yaml
# profile's cordis.patch.yml
- id: dsh-edit-approval
  name: dsh-edit-approval
  config:
    minDiffLines: 2
    includeCreate: false
```

| Namespace | Key | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `edit-approval` | `enabled` | `true` | Master switch for edit approval |
| `edit-approval` | `tools` | `['write','edit','str_replace_editor']` | Whitelist of intercepted registered tool names |
| `edit-approval` | `minDiffLines` | `0` | Ask only when the change touches **at least** this many lines; smaller changes pass silently |
| `edit-approval` | `includeCreate` | `true` | Whether creating a new file asks for approval |
| `edit-approval` | `includeDelete` | `true` | Whether clearing/emptying a file asks for approval |
| `bash-approval` | `enabled` | `false` | Master switch for bash approval |
| `bash-approval` | `tools` | `['bash']` | Whitelist of intercepted registered tool names |
| `bash-approval` | `allow` | `[]` | Command prefixes that always pass (whitespace-normalized) |

The config surface is **forward-compatible by contract**: new keys are only ever added with defaults, never removed or reinterpreted — an older plugin version silently ignores unknown keys, so a newer config file stays safe on an older release.

## What it deliberately does NOT do

- **Escape or expand sandboxing** — it never changes the sandbox mode or grants access; escalation calls pass through to the sandbox's own approval.
- **Intercept inside commands** — file edits performed *inside* a `bash` command are not edit-gated (they are covered by Bash approval, when enabled).
- **Partial application** — the diff is a read-only preview (`+` / `-` line markers); "apply only some lines" is not supported.
- **Ask about calls the tool itself would fail on** — e.g. `str_replace_editor create` against an existing file, a non-unique or missing `old_str` / `old_string`; they pass through for the tool to report. An empty `old_string` `edit` preview deviates from the tool (treated as not-found) — safe, it never falsely blocks.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** (Enter to approve / Esc to reject) — split into the dedicated [dsh-approval-hotkeys](https://github.com/SiriLee/dsh-approval-hotkeys) plugin.
- **Post-edit review / rollback** — covered by the community [dsh-change-review](https://github.com/cirelir/dsh-change-review).
- **Permission-tier extensions** — covered by the community [dsh-auto-approval-plugin](https://github.com/StyxNether/dsh-auto-approval-plugin).

## Compatibility

- Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`.
- DeepSeek Harness web profile (`dsh --profile web`); peer `@deepseek-ai/*` packages are resolved by the harness at runtime.
- The registered tool name is `str_replace_editor` (underscores), distinct from the npm package name `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-str-replace-editor`.

## Security

The plugin reads the target file only to compute the edit preview (at the `tools/pre-execute` interception point); the bash gate touches no files at all. It never writes files itself — the tool body performs the write only after you approve. It makes no network requests and accesses no credentials.

## Development

```sh
npm install            # devDeps from the npm registry
npm run typecheck      # tsc on both compilation surfaces (host + client)
npm test               # vitest: diff / guard / command-guard / display-parity / integration / client suites
npm run build          # full build: tsc → lib/ (with .d.ts) + lib/client.js bundle
npm run build:portable # optional lightweight esbuild build, no typecheck
node scripts/verify-host.mjs   # verify the BUILT host artifact end-to-end (both namespaces, all slash commands)
```

`prepare` runs the full build, so git installs and `npm pack` / `npm publish` always produce a complete `lib/` (with `.d.ts`) and the `LICENSE`.

## Release

Releases go out through GitHub Actions Trusted Publishing (OIDC, no stored `NPM_TOKEN`). See [docs/npm-trusted-publishing-guide.md](docs/npm-trusted-publishing-guide.md).

```sh
npm version patch && git push origin main --tags   # triggers .github/workflows/publish.yml
```

The workflow verifies the tag matches `package.json`, runs typecheck + tests + a full build + artifact verification, publishes with Sigstore provenance, and creates a GitHub Release. CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the same checks on every push / PR. The publish step is idempotent — a version already on npm is skipped.
