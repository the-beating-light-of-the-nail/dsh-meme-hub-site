The plugin adds a compact indicator below the conversation composer. It shows input/output tokens, cache-hit ratio, estimated cost, active model, a multi-segment context-pressure bar (system/tools/messages breakdown, v1.1.0), and DeepSeek account balance. Click it to open a zero-dependency SVG dashboard with per-turn usage history — including a cost view (every bar shows its own cost value, not just the current round), a duration overlay, anomaly markers, an explainer tooltip (tokens + cost + model + billing tier + duration/TTFT/TPS + **user input source attribution: human/agent/continuation**, v1.1.0 + end reason), horizontally scrollable per-round bars (all rounds, fixed slim bar width, auto-scroll to latest), a dedicated **Context & Compaction Diagnostics section** (system/tools/messages token composition, compaction timeline, freed tokens, summarize cost, context occupancy suggestions, v1.1.0), a dismissible `≈ ¥/$0.00xx` badge on each assistant message, peak/off-peak tiered billing with a live red/green billing-tier tag in the panel (red = peak, green = off-peak, v1.0.1), and official dual-currency pricing (CNY from the Chinese pricing page, USD from the English pricing page — no FX conversion, v1.0.1).

```
▸ Input 12.4M · Output 86.2K · Hit 72% · Cost ≈$0.042 / ≈¥0.284 · demo-model · Balance --
```

Click ▸ to open the dashboard panel:

- **Session usage summary** — Input (uncached/cached), output, cache-hit percentage, and context occupancy (derived from official adapter `tokenUsage` / `contextPressure` projections).
- **Context breakdown & compaction diagnostics (v1.1.0)** — Official `contextBreakdown` projection breakdown (System prompt / Tools schema / Message history token counts and percentage with a 3-segment color bar, annotated as heuristic approximations); Host folds `compaction/*` events (which round was compacted, how many tokens were freed, model used, and summarize call cost); provides proactive suggestions (≥75% / ≥90% occupancy) to start a new session or reduce large file injections.
- **Cost estimation** — Estimated from official list prices (CNY/USD dual-currency per 1M tokens, peak/off-peak tiers) with verified source date; supports user override via `pricing.json`; unpriced models are explicitly tagged.
- **Peak / off-peak tiered billing (v1.0.1)** — Peak hours (Beijing time Monday–Friday 09:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00, UTC 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00) billed at 2× the off-peak rate; all other hours and weekends billed at off-peak rates; rounds bill automatically based on start time (or conservative peak if unknown); live red/green tag in the panel header.
- **Official dual-currency list pricing (v1.0.1)** — Builtin official CNY and USD prices directly used according to the active display currency — **no FX conversion applied to costs** (matching official billing); "Refresh rate" updates only the informational "1 USD ≈ X CNY" reference note.
- **Multi-currency display (v0.3 / v1.0.1)** — One-click toggle between USD and CNY (persisted in localStorage); indicator, panel, chart, and badges all follow.
- **Per-round usage & source attribution (v1.1.0)** — "Total / Composition / **Cost**" view modes; cost mode shows each bar's monetary amount; duration line overlay; anomaly marker chips on cost spikes; cache hit miniature ticks; hover explainer card with full round metrics + **user input source attribution: human/agent/continuation**; horizontal scroll for full session history.
- **Cost badge** — Dismissible `≈ ¥/$0.00xx` badge rendered at the bottom of each assistant message.
- **Multi-segment context pressure bar (v1.1.0)** — Slim bar in the composer dock indicating total context occupancy from green to red, segmented by System (blue), Tools (amber), and Messages (green) with hover percentages.
- **Account balance** — Real-time balance queried via official DeepSeek API (proxied securely through Host, API key never exposed to browser).
- **Bilingual (ZH / EN)** — Automatically follows DSH in-app language setting, with runtime switching between `zh` and `en`.

## Data sources

| Metric | Source | Accuracy |
|---|---|---|
| Token usage | DSH official adapter session projections (`tokenUsage` / `contextPressure`) | ✅ Official real-time data |
| Cost | Official list price (builtin + optional `pricing.json` override, CNY/USD dual-currency / 1M tokens, peak/off-peak tiers) × reported usage | ⚠️ Estimate, not invoice; resolved via Host `/pricing` snapshot |
| Display currency | Host `/meta` config; costs directly calculated in selected currency list price | ✅ Official dual-currency list price |
| Per-round history | Host session log fold (`/usage`): duration / TTFT / TPS / model attribution / **input source attribution** / end reason / per-round cost | ✅ Official event stream fold |
| Context & compaction | Official `contextBreakdown` / `contextPressure` projections + Host `compaction/*` event fold | ✅ Official projections + event fold |
| Balance | Official `GET https://api.deepseek.com/user/balance` | ✅ Official real-time data |
| Model name | Adapter request provenance / `request/context` | ✅ Official real-time data |

## Tech stack

- **Language**: TypeScript source, compiled to DSH loadable JavaScript bundles
- **Framework**: [Cordis](https://github.com/cordiverse/cordis) plugin model + React 18
- **Build**: esbuild (Host half = Node ESM; Client half = browser factory bundle matching DSH Web `PLATFORM_MODULES`)
- **Visualization**: Zero-dependency handcrafted SVG (matches platform rendering, minimal footprint, ultra-stable)

## Install

Prerequisites: **[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) ≥ 0.1.0-rc.6** · **Node.js ≥ 20** · **[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/install) on PATH** (`dsh plugin` forwards installs to pnpm).

> If you get `dsh: command not found` (or PowerShell `The term 'dsh' is not recognized…`),
> you ran `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh` transiently — see FAQ item 1 (install globally, or prefix commands with `npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh`).

### Option 1: npm registry (recommended, prebuilt — no build tooling needed)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-usage-chart   # installs and registers the profile plugin layer
dsh web --profile web                          # starts DSH Web (stop it first if already running)
```

To update (upgrade to a new version): pnpm may print `Already up to date` when already installed — use an **explicit version** (recommended) or **remove then re-add**:

```sh
# Option ①: pin the target version explicitly
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-usage-chart@1.1.2
# Option ②: remove, then re-add (back to latest)
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-usage-chart
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-usage-chart
```

Then restart DSH Web.

> ⚠️ **Restarting the `dsh web` process is required after any upgrade.** The Host caches plugin code in memory (no hot reload): new routes (e.g. `/pricing`, `/meta`, `/rate`) are only served after a restart. See the [Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md).

### Option 2: install from GitHub (source build)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Max-Samson/dsh-usage-chart#<commit-sha>
```

Git installs run the package `prepare` script (`node build.mjs`) to build from source. pnpm ≥ 10 blocks `prepare` scripts by default — allow this package in the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, then re-run:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-usage-chart: true
```

### Option 3: local directory (development)

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Max-Samson/dsh-usage-chart.git
cd dsh-usage-chart
npm ci && npm run build
dsh plugin --profile web add "$PWD"   # links the current checkout
dsh web --profile web
```

### Verify the install

1. The composed profile should contain the plugin row:

   ```sh
   dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A4 'id: dsh-usage-chart'
   ```

2. Open DSH Web and enter any existing session: the "Usage" indicator (tokens / cost / model) appears below the composer, with the account balance on the right; click ▸ to open the dashboard.

### Balance query configuration

The balance query needs a DeepSeek API key, resolved per request in this order (no restart needed):

1. **DSH Web settings (recommended, requires plugin ≥ 0.1.1)**: configure the DeepSeek API key under Settings → Models. The plugin reads the same key through the DSH credentials service (`.credentials.yaml` user layer); no extra setup is required.
2. **Environment variable**: `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...` before starting `dsh web` (the credentials service's `env` layer resolves it the same way).
3. **Plugin config**: override `config.apiKey` in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (stored in plain text on disk — only recommended for a protected local profile):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-usage-chart
      name: dsh-usage-chart
      config:
        apiKey: 'sk-...'        # empty falls back to web settings / env variable
        baseUrl: 'https://api.deepseek.com'
        # pricingFile: '/path/to/pricing.json'   # optional: price override file
        # currency: 'cny'        # optional (v0.3): 'usd' (default) | 'cny'
        # cnyPerUsd: 6.76        # optional (v0.3): FX rate for note display
        # fxUrl: 'https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD'   # optional (v0.3): custom live rate source
```

The key stays in the Host process and is never sent to the browser.

### Price overrides (optional, v0.2+ / v1.0.1 dual-currency, tiered)

Costs are resolved with priority **user override file > builtin list price > fallback estimate** (prices are resolved only on the Host; the client consumes the `/dsh-usage-chart/pricing` snapshot — a single source of truth, ADR 2). The default override file is `$DSH_HOME/data/dsh-usage-chart/pricing.json` (or `~/.dsh/...` without `DSH_HOME`); both flat and `{ "models": { … } }` shapes are accepted and changes are picked up live:

```json
{
  "deepseek-v4-flash": {
    "offPeak": {
      "cny": { "cacheMissInput": 1.5, "cacheHitInput": 0.05, "output": 4.5 },
      "usd": { "cacheMissInput": 0.22, "cacheHitInput": 0.007, "output": 0.66 }
    },
    "peak": {
      "cny": { "cacheMissInput": 3.0, "cacheHitInput": 0.10, "output": 9.0 },
      "usd": { "cacheMissInput": 0.44, "cacheHitInput": 0.014, "output": 1.32 }
    },
    "verifiedAt": 1755100800000
  }
}
```

Unit prices are **dual-currency (CNY + USD) per 1M tokens**: `peak` covers peak hours (Beijing time Monday–Friday 09:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00, charged at 2×), `offPeak` covers the rest (including weekends). Unpriced models are explicitly marked "Unpriced model" in the UI.

### Display currency and live FX rate (v0.3+ / v1.0.1 official dual-currency)

Costs are computed with the **official list price of the selected currency** (CNY quote from the Chinese pricing page, USD quote from the English pricing page — **no FX conversion**, consistent with the official bill). The cost section has a one-click **CNY/USD** toggle (remembered in the browser); the indicator, panel, chart and badge all follow it. `config.cnyPerUsd` (default 6.76) and the "Refresh rate" button (via Host `/dsh-usage-chart/rate` proxy) are used only for the informational "1 USD ≈ X CNY" note:

- **Multi-source fallback**: when the custom source (`config.fxUrl`) is unreachable, a built-in fallback source (frankfurter.dev) is tried;
- **Offline resilience**: the last successful rate is persisted, so a refresh while offline keeps the last real rate instead of the fixed default;
- **Config distribution**: the Host `/dsh-usage-chart/meta` route sends the display currency and rate config to the client.

### Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-usage-chart   # removes the dependency and de-registers the layer
dsh web --profile web                             # restart; indicator and panel disappear
```

`remove` also cleans the package out of `node_modules` and `dsh.profile.bundles` (no leftovers).

## FAQ

**Q: `dsh` is not found (`command not found` / PowerShell `The term 'dsh' is not recognized`)?**
A: `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh` runs transiently and installs no global command. Run `npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh` and open a new terminal, or prefix commands with `npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh ...`. Missing pnpm is the same: `npm install -g pnpm`.

**Q: Install shows `WARN missing peer react@^18.2.0`?**
A: Harmless — react is provided by the DSH Web platform in the browser; the profile does not need it. Plugin ≥ 0.1.1 marks react as an optional peer.

**Q: The balance still shows `–` / "not configured" after setting the API key in the web UI?**
A: Make sure the plugin is ≥ 0.1.1, then restart `dsh web`. As a stopgap, set `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` or `config.apiKey`.

**Q: `add` reports `dsh-usage-chart is not in the npm registry`?**
A: Use "Option 3: local directory" to test, or wait for the maintainer to publish.

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Max-Samson/dsh-usage-chart.git
cd dsh-usage-chart
npm ci
npm run verify       # typecheck + build + node:test
npm pack --dry-run   # check package tarball
```

### Visual probe scripts (optional)

`scripts/` provides playwright-core based probes targeting a running DSH Web instance (`http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DSH_PROBE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:3080` | Target DSH Web URL |
| `DSH_PROBE_CHROME` | Platform default | Path to Chrome/Chromium executable |
| `DSH_PROBE_SESSION` | Builtin list | Target session title fragment |
| `DSH_PROBE_ARTIFACTS` | `<repo>/artifacts` | Screenshot output directory |

```sh
node scripts/shot.mjs          # Take collapsed/expanded screenshots
node scripts/probe-panel.mjs   # Test panel container clipping
node scripts/probe-popover.mjs # Test popover bounds and toggle
node scripts/verify-render.mjs # Full render verification (light/dark themes, ZH/EN)
```

## Maintainer releases

For the first release, complete npm account verification and run `npm publish --access public` locally. Once the package exists on npm, configure Trusted Publishing for this repository. Subsequent GitHub Releases publish new versions through the workflow.

1. Ensure `package.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` versions match and run `npm run verify`.
2. Create `v<version>` GitHub Release.
3. `release.yml` publishes the prebuilt package via npm Trusted Publishing with provenance.

## Data and security boundaries

- Token and context data come from the active DSH session projections; per-round chart reads the session log and falls back to page-observed deltas if unavailable.
- Costs are estimated based on official list prices (user-overridable via `pricing.json`); price resolution happens only on the Host.
- Currency and rates: `/meta` delivers display config; `/rate` proxies live FX rates via the Host (browser never directly contacts external rate providers); rate URLs require HTTPS (loopback HTTP allowed for local testing).
- Balance is queried via the same-origin Host proxy (direct browser requests have CORS and key-exposure risks).
- Host routes only accept same-origin GET requests and set `no-store` on JSON responses; the plugin never sends the API key to the browser.
