[![DeepSeek Harness](https://img.shields.io/badge/DeepSeek%20Harness-plugin-8b5cf6)](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)

A **reproducible science workbench** plugin for the [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It blends the best of three worlds:

- **Jupyter** — cells and inline figures you can see and re-run;
- **Claude Science** — an agent as the execution engine;
- **Nextflow / nf-core** — every artifact carries full provenance.

> **Core promise**: every figure and artifact is traceable and replayable. You can always answer *“it = which code + which inputs + which environment + which params/seed”*, and re-run it in one click.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Code → figure → feedback → redraw** — the agent runs a self-contained cell to produce figures shown inline; you attach structured feedback to a figure, and `bio_rerun_cell` regenerates a derived version (`v1 → v2 → v3`).
- **One ledger per project** — a plain-text `manifest.json` is the single source of truth: cells, artifacts, provenance and feedback history.
- **Reproducible by construction** — self-contained scripts, a fresh subprocess per cell, `environment.lock`, SHA-256 input/output hashes and a fixed seed.
- **Git-versioned automatically** — each project is `git init`-ed on creation and auto-committed at every step (never pushed).
- **Cross-platform** — the Host shell layer speaks bash on macOS/Linux and PowerShell on Windows; Python resolves to `python` on Windows and `python3` on POSIX.

## 🛠 Tools

Nine agent-facing tools, plus a browser workbench:

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bio_init_project` | Create/open a project: `code/ data/ figures/` + `manifest.json` + `environment.lock` + `git init`. |
| `bio_run_cell` | Run one self-contained cell, discover figures, register artifacts with hashes, commit. |
| `bio_rerun_cell` | Re-run a cell with edited code as a derived version (lineage recorded). |
| `bio_add_feedback` | Attach structured feedback to an artifact (this is how a “redraw it” note becomes history). |
| `bio_get_project` | Return a project summary: cells, artifacts, provenance and feedback. |
| `bio_list_projects` | List all projects under the projects root. |
| `bio_set_projects_dir` | Set the root directory where projects live (persisted across restarts). |
| `bio_delete_cell` | Delete a cell and its produced artifacts (script + figures). |
| `bio_mark_cell` | Mark a cell as a final (成品) artifact, or unmark it — flagged in the workbench and index. |

The **“Analysis workbench”** tab shows the notebook, artifacts, provenance and feedback in a three-panel UI with inline figure preview (PNG/JPEG/SVG/PDF/TIFF/BMP), a **searchable project picker** (filter by name, sorted by most-recent activity), a **cell search box**, a **native directory picker** for the projects root, and a **mark-as-final** badge on completed cells. Very large figures (multi-MB) load on demand and display in full.

The plugin also bundles two **publication-grade figure skills** (adapted from Claude Science, Apache-2.0): `figure-style` (figure correctness & legibility rules + `apply_figure_style()`) and `figure-composer` (multi-panel figure composition with an adversarial self-review loop). See `skills/` and [ATTRIBUTIONS.md](./ATTRIBUTIONS.md).

## 📸 Feature showcase

The **feedback → redraw loop** — every figure keeps its structured feedback history, and a one-click “让 agent 重画” (let the agent redraw) produces a derived version.

The workbench tab — a three-panel layout: the **analysis steps** list (with status and lineage `cell_0001 → cell_0001_v2 → cell_0001_v3`) on the left, and the **artifact detail** (inline figure + provenance / code tabs + script / delete / Finder actions) on the right.

The **code** tab — every artifact’s generating script carries its declaration header (cell / title / language / seed / params / inputs), so it can be reviewed and reused at any time.

The **provenance** tab — full provenance: producing cell, output SHA-256 hash, params, seed, derived-from and created time.

## 📦 Install

`dsh-science-workbench` is a dual-face DSH plugin (Host + Client). Install it with the standard `dsh plugin` command — a thin pnpm forwarder that installs the package into a profile and **automatically adds it to `dsh.profile.bundles`** (because the package declares `dsh.bundle.patch`).

```bash
# From npm (published):
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-science-workbench

# Local development (from a checkout):
dsh plugin --profile web add file:/path/to/dsh-science-workbench
```

Then restart `dsh web`. The `bio_*` tools become globally available, the workbench tab appears, and the plugin shows up under **Settings → Plugins**.

## 🚀 Quick start

After installing and restarting, just ask the agent in plain language:

> “帮我用 `demo_tss` 项目画一个 TSS 附近的信号热图。”

The agent will drive the tools for you. The equivalent manual flow is:

```text
1. bio_init_project { name: "demo_tss" }
2. bio_run_cell { title: "TSS profile", code: "..." }   # writes figures/*.png
3. look at the inline figure → bio_add_feedback { artifactPath, text: "把配色改成 Blues" }
4. bio_rerun_cell { cellId: "cell_0001", editedCode: "..." }  # → cell_0001_v2 + new figure
```

Every step is committed to the project’s git history and recorded in `manifest.json`, so the whole lineage (`cell_0001 → cell_0001_v2 → …`) stays inspectable.

## 🧪 Reproducibility model

Each cell is a **self-contained script** with a declaration header:

```python
# @cell: cell_0001
# @title: TSS profile
# @language: python
# @seed: 42
# @params: {"colorMap": "Blues"}
# @inputs: ["data/peaks.bed"]
# @outputs: []
```

It runs in a **fresh subprocess** with `cwd = project root`. On completion the Host:

1. discovers figures written to `figures/` and prefixes them with the cell id;
2. hashes every input and output (SHA-256) into the artifact record;
3. appends the cell + artifacts to `manifest.json` and updates `index.md`;
4. commits everything to the project’s local git repo.

## 📁 Project layout

```
<workspace>/bio-projects/<name>/
├─ manifest.json        # single source of truth: cells + artifacts + provenance + feedback
├─ environment.lock     # interpreter version + pip freeze snapshot
├─ index.md             # human-readable project index
├─ code/                # one self-contained script per cell (cell_0001.py, cell_0001_v2.py, …)
├─ data/                # input data
├─ figures/             # figures (cell-prefixed, e.g. cell_0001_tss_profile.png)
└─ .git/                # auto-created, auto-committed
```

## 🧩 Architecture

- **Host** (`lib/index.js`) is the single source of truth. It registers the `bio_*` tools into the host `tools` registry, does all execution/provenance, and serves the `/biowb/*` data routes through the `webServer` service.
- **Client** (`lib/client.js`) is a pure projection — a hand-written browser bundle that reads/writes over same-origin `fetch('/biowb/<method>')`. No typert Remote bridge and no harness monorepo build are required.
- The **convention skill** (`skills/bio-workbench`) teaches the agent the project layout, the cell contract and the feedback loop.
