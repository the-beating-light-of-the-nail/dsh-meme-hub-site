# Treg (OpenRouter for Tools)

![treg — the tool catalog for your agent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/superdesigndev/treg/a45e17f12a917c5643c3d3482691f140bdd16537/docs/assets/treg-hero.png)

**OpenRouter, but for agent tools instead of models.** Point an agent at one base URL with one token
and it can do the job: **~2,850 catalogued endpoints across ~57 providers** — SEO and backlinks,
social and trends, people and company enrichment, ads, scraping — **priced per call, from a cent**,
with no provider signup. Plus your own team's keys, skills and CLIs, callable by every teammate's
agent without the credential ever leaving the server.

**Ask for the task, not the tool.** You do not need to know which vendor sells backlink data, or to
hold an account with them. Search for what you want to do, read the price, call it.

Built for the Superdesign team, live at [treg.to](https://treg.to) — anyone can self-host.

## Why it exists

The tools an agent needs for real work sit behind subscriptions nobody buys for a single run —
Semrush $139/mo, Moz $99/mo, Crunchbase $99/mo, Apollo $59/seat — behind signup walls, or behind no
public API at all (invite-only, partner-only, app-review-only). treg carries those accounts and
bills fractions of a cent per call.

## Two kinds of tool, one token

- **The catalog** — external endpoints treg can serve **on its own key**, metered against your
  team's prepaid balance (**$1.00 free** on every new team). No account with the provider needed.
- **Your own tools** — anything a teammate registered: a paid API account, an OAuth connection, a
  vendor CLI, a `SKILL.md`. **Your own key always wins over treg's, and those calls are never
  metered.**

The vocabulary for the second half:

- **tool** = something the registry calls for you with the org's credential. Two kinds:
  - **endpoint** — an upstream `base_url` + credential **bindings** (each binding injects one
  secret into the request; a request can carry several, e.g. an OAuth bearer *and* a
  `developer-token` header).
  - **CLI** — a vendor binary (`stripe`, `gh`, `vercel`, ...) run with the credential injected.
- **skill / bundle** = a recipe (`SKILL.md`) + its secrets + its tool(s), registered together.

**The one rule:** the proxy **relays, never models** the upstream, and **injects auth server-side**
— so it survives upstream API changes and callers never hold keys.

# Part 1 · Using the registry

Visit [**treg.to**](https://treg.to) (hosted on Render) — the dashboard,
sign-in, and every URL below live there.

## Quickstart

Same flow as the dashboard's **Getting started** guide:

```bash
# 1. install the CLI — also points it at the registry
curl -fsSL https://treg.to/install.sh | sh

# 2. sign in (GitHub default · --email for a one-time code · --token for agents/CI)
treg login

# 3. do something useful immediately — no key, nothing registered
treg catalog search "backlinks for a domain"     # find a tool by what it DOES
treg call tikhub.tiktok.user.profile --query uniqueId=tiktok
treg balance                                     # exactly what that cost

# (or `treg onboard` for the guided walkthrough)
```

Your token identifies you on every call (`X-Treg-Token` header) and is the same for all tools.
Discover what your team has shared: `treg tool ls` · check credential health: `treg health`.

### Or install it as a Claude Code plugin

```
/plugin marketplace add superdesigndev/treg
/plugin install treg@treg
```

Installs with no token and no configuration. The skill loads as `treg:treg` and, on its first run,
walks your agent through the rest — the CLI, sign-in, then `treg mcp install` — so you end up with
the command line **and** treg's tools. Other agents: `npx skills add superdesigndev/treg -s treg`
(the `-s` matters — without it you also get this repo's internal dev skills).
See [docs/CLAUDE-PLUGIN.md](docs/CLAUDE-PLUGIN.md).

## Call a tool you don't have a key for

The catalog is grouped by what endpoints **do**: keyword and rank tracking, backlinks and authority,
AI visibility, trending and discovery, publishing to socials, people and company enrichment, ads
management and creative, measurement.

```bash
treg catalog                                    # every platform, busiest first
treg catalog search "find a work email"         # by the job, not the vendor
treg catalog get hunter.people.email.find       # params, PRICE, example response
treg call hunter.people.email.find --query domain=reddit.com --query full_name="Alexis Ohanian"
```

**How a catalogued call is served** — the credential ladder, in order:

1. your team registered its own tool for that provider → that tool, that key;
2. your team stored a secret for the provider → injected through a virtual tool;
3. neither → **treg's own key**, billed to the team's prepaid balance.

Your own credential always beats treg's, so connecting a key you already pay for makes those calls
free of the balance rather than duplicating them. An endpoint treg has no published price for is
**refused**, not served free — you are told to connect your own key instead. Where several providers
serve one capability, `treg catalog search` shows them side by side with prices; **choosing is
yours** — treg does not silently pick or fail over for you.

```bash
treg balance          # credit left, calls in flight, recent spend
treg topup            # add funds, or set up automatic top-ups
```

Out of balance is an HTTP **402** carrying `balance_micro`, `estimated_cost_micro` and a `topup_url`,
so an agent can act on it without reading prose.

## Share & use your own tools

The zero-thought path — point treg at a project and it figures out what's shareable:

```bash
treg scan     # read-only preview: the keys, skills & CLIs upload would register
treg upload   # register them (encrypted server-side); idempotent, --replace to update
```

`treg upload` scans the `.env` (matching keys against ~80 known providers), every skill
subdirectory, and installed catalog CLIs. Three kinds of things go into the registry — here's how
to share and use each:

### 1. Endpoints (HTTP APIs)

**Share** — one upstream URL callable with a stored key, or bulk from a `.env`:

```bash
treg secret add STRIPE_KEY --value sk_live_123
treg add stripe --base-url https://api.stripe.com --secret STRIPE_KEY

treg upload env --select openai,stripe,resend     # or straight from the .env
```

**Use** — the agent-native way: build the **real** upstream request and prefix it with the proxy.
treg resolves the tool by host, injects the credential, and relays everything else faithfully
(your `X-Treg-Token` is stripped before the upstream sees it):

```
Real request:   GET https://api.intercom.io/conversations?per_page=5
Through treg:   GET https://treg.to/call/https://api.intercom.io/conversations?per_page=5
                    header:  X-Treg-Token: <your token>
```

Or the CLI shorthand — and `treg calls` for the audit log:

```bash
treg call intercom conversations --query per_page=5
treg call stripe v1/balance
```

### 2. CLIs

**Share** — automatic: `treg upload` detects installed catalog CLIs (`stripe`, `gh`, `vercel`, …)
and registers them; a recipe-only catalog CLI skill (e.g. `stripe-cli`) auto-becomes runnable too.

**Use** — `treg run` executes the vendor CLI **with the org's credential injected**, so you never
hold the key or log in:

```bash
treg run stripe -- get /v1/balance
treg run gh -- pr list
treg run --server agentmail-cli inboxes list   # runs on the registry server: the key never reaches you
```

`--local` (default) runs on your machine; `--server` runs on the registry and streams output back.
For a whole session, `treg shell start` opens a subshell where every registered CLI injects
automatically — just use `stripe`, `gh`, … normally; `exit` reverts. `treg runs` is the audit log.

### 3. Skills

**Share** — a skill is a whole capability (`SKILL.md` recipe + its secrets + its tool(s)),
registered together so the whole team runs the same skill, maintained in one place:

```bash
treg upload skills --dir ~/.claude/skills --all   # register a folder of skills in one pass
```

**Use** — pull any shared skill into your agent; its API calls go through treg with your token,
so the key stays on the server, never in the skill:

```bash
treg skill install seo-blog-writer      # writes into ./.claude/skills/  (--all for the library)
```

### Manual registration — when the heuristics can't figure a tool out

```bash
# multi-credential tool (e.g. google-ads: OAuth bearer + a developer-token header)
treg tool add google-ads --base-url https://googleads.googleapis.com \
  --bind "secret=<oauth-id>,injector=oauth" \
  --bind "secret=<dev-id>,name=developer-token,format={secret}"

# one skill, step by step
treg skill init --dir ./my-skill          # drafts treg.json (guesses base_url, finds secrets)
treg skill add  --dir ./my-skill          # registers recipe + secrets + tool, atomically

# OAuth via the browser (mints the first token, treg holds it and auto-refreshes)
treg oauth connect gsc --client-secret client_secret.json \
  --scopes https://www.googleapis.com/auth/webmasters.readonly
```

Full options for every command: [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md).

## Teams

Everything is scoped to an **org**: a token = a `(user, org)` membership, and every secret, tool,
and skill belongs to the active org. Roles: **owner / admin / member / viewer**.

```bash
treg org create "Acme"                        # make a team, become owner
treg org invite teammate@acme.com             # invite by email (pick role + tool access)
treg org join <code> --email you@acme.com     # accept an invite (creates you if new)
treg org ls | use <slug> | members            # switch orgs, see the roster
treg org access <member> --tools a,b          # per-member tool access (admin+)
```

## Going deeper

- [`USAGE.md`](USAGE.md) — the full `treg` CLI reference.
- [`/llms.txt`](https://treg.to/llms.txt) — the agent-onboarding file: call
protocol, discovery, auth, CLI, skills. One fetch teaches an agent the whole registry.
- **The dashboard** at [treg.to](https://treg.to) — full CRUD, a guided
tutorial (Help → Tutorial), and copyable setup instructions for your agents.
- **The API** — everything the CLI does is plain HTTP; interactive OpenAPI docs live at `/docs`.
The proxy endpoint is `/call/{...}`; all endpoints take the `X-Treg-Token` header.

# Part 2 · Self-hosting & development

## Run it locally

One command (needs `tmux` + [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/); it syncs the venv itself):

```bash
scripts/dev-local.sh up        # server on http://localhost:18790, dev-safe settings
```

That runs the server in tmux with hot-reload, its own sqlite DB (`treg-dev.db`), and email OTP dev
mode (sign-in codes shown on the page — no mail sender needed). Day-to-day:

```bash
scripts/dev-local.sh cli login   # sandboxed CLI: never touches your real ~/.treg/config.json
scripts/dev-local.sh logs        # server output          · status / restart / down
scripts/dev-local.sh reset       # wipe the dev DB + CLI sandbox for a fresh start
```

Or run the server directly, without tmux:

```bash
uv sync                        # create the venv from uv.lock (pulls the server deps for dev)
uv run python -m treg          # serve on 0.0.0.0:18790 (add --reload for dev)
uv run python -m treg keygen   # print a fresh Fernet key for TREG_SECRET_KEY
```

> **Installing to run a server (not from source):** the base package is the **CLI only**. To run a
> registry, install the server extra — `pip install "tools-registry[server]"` — which adds FastAPI, the
> database drivers, and encryption. `pip install tools-registry` alone gives just the `treg` command for
> talking to an existing registry.

The team instance is hosted on **Render** (web service + Postgres) at `treg.to`.

## Configuration

Environment variables (prefix `TREG_`, read from `.env`):


| Var                                       | Default                         | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `TREG_ADMIN_TOKEN`                        | *(empty)*                       | cross-tenant **super-admin** bearer; authorizes every `/admin/*` endpoint. Empty disables the env path (only `is_superadmin` users reach `/admin`). Keep it long + secret. |
| `TREG_EMAIL_DEV_MODE`                     | `false`                         | when true, `/auth/email/start` returns the OTP in its response (no mail sender needed) — **dev/local only**, never in prod.                                                |


No `.env` is needed for local dev — every setting has a working default (ephemeral key, sqlite).

> **⚠️ Back these up before moving or redeploying:** the Fernet key (`TREG_SECRET_KEY`) and the
> database (Postgres in prod; `treg.db` for a local sqlite run). Lose the Fernet key and every
> stored secret becomes unrecoverable.

## Architecture

**Request flow for `/call`:** resolve tool (by URL host + longest `base_url` prefix, or by name) →
decrypt its secret(s) → apply each binding's injector → stream to the upstream → fire-and-forget
audit record. The proxy does no business logic and never buffers the body.

**Module map** (`src/treg/`):


| Module                                     | Role                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `proxy.py`                                 | `relay()` — the whole product in one function: a faithful streaming proxy                                        |
| `injectors.py`                             | the auth-shape seam: `env`, `cli_auth`, `secret_file`, `oauth` place a secret into a header/query                |
| `oauth.py`                                 | token freshness (single-flight refresh) + the connect flow (consent URL, code exchange)                          |
| `health.py`                                | credential health: refresh oauth, probe tools, webhook the owner of anything broken                              |
| `convert.py`                               | scaffold a skill directory into a registerable bundle manifest                                                   |
| `api.py`                                   | the API — the only brain; CLI + skill are thin clients over it                                                   |
| `cli.py`                                   | the `treg` CLI                                                                                                   |
| `models.py`                                | SQLModel tables: `Org`, `User`, `Membership`, `Invite`, `Secret`, `Tool`, `Bundle`, `PendingOAuth`, `CallRecord` |
| `crypto.py` `config.py` `db.py` `audit.py` | Fernet encryption + tokens · settings · async DB · deferred audit writer                                         |


**The 4 auth shapes** (per binding `injector`): `env` (plain string / API key) · `secret_file` (a
JSON token file, pull a field) · `oauth` (a JSON OAuth token, auto-refreshed if refreshable) ·
`cli_auth` (material lifted from a CLI's keychain).

**Faithful-relay contract:** the proxy alters **only** three things, everything else is verbatim:

1. hop-by-hop transport headers (re-derived per hop),
2. treg's own control + edge-forwarding headers (`x-treg-token`, `x-treg-org`,
`ngrok-skip-browser-warning`, `x-forwarded-*`, `via`, …) and treg's session cookie — all stripped,
never leak upstream,
3. the injected credential(s).

**OAuth, three ways to get the first token:** *manual upload* (drop in a `token.json`) ·
*auto-refresh* (if the token carries `refresh_token` + client creds, treg keeps it fresh, you never
re-upload) · *hosted connect flow* (`treg oauth connect` → browser consent → treg captures the
token itself).

**Health checks:** give a tool an optional probe (`{method, path, expect_status}`); a periodic run
(on demand or via cron) validates every credential, refreshes OAuth, and webhooks the owner of any
that break.

Deep design lives in [`docs/context/`](docs/context/README.md) (per-subsystem fragments).
