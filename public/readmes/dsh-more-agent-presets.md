# dsh-more-agent-presets

[中文文档](README.zh.md)

Multiple selectable Agent Presets for DeepSeek Harness.

The presets are adapted for DeepSeek Harness (DSH).

## Benefits

This plugin is particularly useful for:

**Non-DeepSeek or Older Models:**
- Improves performance for models that haven't been specifically adapted for DSH
- Enhances older models that lack DSH-specific adaptations

**Personal Preference:**
- Some users may prefer more interactive, discussion-based coding assistance over independent work

**Why It Helps:**
- DSH's default prompts are optimized for DeepSeek models
- Non-DeepSeek or older models may not perform optimally with default prompts
- These presets provide alternative interaction patterns suitable for different models

## Available Presets

### Qwen Code Coding Mode (`qwencode-coding-agent`)

A professional coding assistant emphasizing code standards and project conventions, using iterative workflows and CLI-friendly interaction style.

### IFlow Coding Mode (`iflow-coding-agent`)

An interactive CLI agent with dynamic environment awareness, automatic Git context injection, and structured task workflows. Features auto-detected platform information, security-first permissions handling, and CLI-optimized communication style.

### IFlow Creation Mode (`iflow-cre-agent`)

An enhanced mode for creating custom Agent presets. Includes all standard capabilities plus runtime inspection, plugin experimentation, and preset authoring guidance.

**Features:**
- DSH context information (Web UI URL, source root)
- Git repository awareness
- Custom prompt sections
- Skills for Cordis plugin development and composition editing

**Current Limitation:**
⚠️ Cordis Tool (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-cordis`) is currently unavailable due to upstream issues. Dynamic Cordis plugin creation will be available after upstream fixes.

### Pair Coding Mode (`pair-coding-agent`)

A coding assistant that works alongside the user as a pair programmer: aligns direction before each move, discusses before non-trivial edits, and waits for confirmation rather than driving the task to completion on its own. 

## Design Philosophy

These presets differ from the default DSH prompt in their approach to user interaction and planning:

**Interaction Style:**

- Default DSH: Works independently with minimal user interaction
- Qwen/IFlow/Pair: Actively discusses with users, maintaining communication throughout

**Plan Mode:**

- Default DSH: Static approval process — AI produces a complete plan document, then waits for user approval
- Qwen/IFlow/Pair: Dynamic collaboration — AI iterates with the user through multiple rounds, refining the plan step by step

## Known Limitations

**Preset display text does not follow the Web UI locale.** The `name` and `description` for every preset shipped by this plugin are read from each preset's `preset.yml` and rendered verbatim by the Web UI, regardless of which UI language is selected. Only the four presets shipped with DeepSeek Harness itself (`standard`, `code`, `minimal`, `cordis`) are localized through the harness's i18n system; community-shipped presets, including every preset in this plugin, are not. Switching the Web UI from Chinese to English will leave these presets' display text in Chinese.

This is a limitation of how the harness consumes preset metadata, not of this plugin. As of this writing the harness exposes no mechanism for plugins to register localized strings for their own presets.

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:R-LEI2536/dsh-more-agent-presets
```

Restart the Web profile, then select the preset when creating a session.

The plugin installs its managed preset directories under `$DSH_HOME/.agent-presets` (normally `~/.dsh/.agent-presets`). For detailed installation behavior, see the [Installation Behavior](#installation-behavior) section below.

## Installation Behavior

The plugin implements the following installation logic:

**Dynamic Discovery:**
- Automatically scans the `presets/` directory to discover available presets
- No need to manually update preset lists

**Version-Based Updates:**
- Compares version numbers to determine if presets need updating
- Reinstalls presets when the plugin version changes
- Skips installation if versions match (avoids unnecessary overwrites)

**Ownership Management:**
- Each installed preset includes a `.dsh-preset-owner.json` marker file
- Records the managing package name and version
- Ensures safe cleanup and prevents conflicts with other plugins

**Automatic Cleanup:**
- Removes presets that are no longer provided by the plugin
- Only deletes presets owned by this plugin (respects other plugins and user-created presets)

**Safety Guarantees:**
- ✅ Never overwrites presets from other plugins
- ✅ Never deletes user-created presets without ownership markers
- ✅ Only manages presets it has installed

## Remove

```bash
# Remove the plugin package
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-more-agent-presets

# Optionally, remove the installed presets
rm -rf ~/.dsh/.agent-presets/qwencode-coding-agent
```

**Note:** 
- Removing the plugin does not automatically delete the installed preset directories
- Preset directories with ownership markers (`.dsh-preset-owner.json`) can be re-managed if you reinstall the plugin
- To completely remove presets, manually delete them as shown above
