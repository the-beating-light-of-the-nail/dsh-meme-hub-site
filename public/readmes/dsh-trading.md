# dsh-trading

A trading **research** workbench built as plugins for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`). No fork, no patched core — just a bundle you stack on the stock `web` or `headless` profile.

> **Status: early scaffold.** dsh itself is in developer preview and moves fast; expect breaking changes on both sides.

## The workbench

Under `dsh web` with the optional shell frame, the app becomes chart-first: a
persistent, live chart column on the left, the conversation on the right.

   rail        the chart you drive          the agent you talk to
```

The column is **yours**: type a symbol, pick a timeframe, and it fetches over a
loopback channel without going through the model at all. It also **follows the
conversation** — when the agent charts something, the column loads that
instrument *live* rather than mirroring the agent's frozen snapshot. Touching
the chart at all — a symbol, a timeframe — **pins** it, and a 📌 chip says so;
from then on the agent's drawings arrive as a **Show** offer on a pill instead
of taking the chart out from under you. Click the chip to start following
again.

Drawings work the same way in both directions. `annotate_chart` levels, zones
and paths land on the live column; the *prose* half of the same analysis —
the level table, the bull/bear scenario cards — stays in chat, where reading
text belongs. And the loop closes: the panel publishes what it is showing back
to the host, so the agent can read your chart (`get_chart_view`, plus a
one-line context injection each turn) instead of asking you to screenshot it.

## Demo

![The chart column is pinned to Micron while the agent's marks are for Bitcoin, so nothing lands; a pill offers them, and one click loads that chart with its six marks](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maddogfinance/dsh-trading/f26dbca15beef1a0e139a5c7db5155d3734cfb7c/media/workbench-preview.gif)

The column is pinned to Micron. The agent's six marks are for Bitcoin — a
different instrument, so the predicate refuses the merge and **nothing lands
on the wrong chart**. They are offered on a pill instead; one click loads that
chart with its marks. The clock in the top-right corner is a live feed off a
local OpenD, ticking through the whole clip.

▶ **[Watch the full 90-second demo with narration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULeROBoBGTc)** —
the loop above is one beat of it. The full cut also walks the shell, the
symbol box and the timeframe row, the agent drawing on the live column, and
the per-turn context line that lets it read your chart without asking for a
screenshot.

None of it is a mockup: the footage is 1920x1080 Playwright captures of a real
session against a live Futu OpenD, and the chart keeps ticking through every
shot.

Recorded before the chart-first shell existed, and still exactly how the `web`
surface behaves *without* `@dsh-trading/client-frame`: the agent answers with
an interactive chart card, chips draw indicator panes from the exact per-bar
series the model read, and `annotate_chart` puts levels on the chart through a
trust gate — mandatory provenance, prices validated against the real candle
window.

## Design

Eight packages, one direction of dependency:

```
@dsh-trading/tool-market      model-facing tools (list_symbols, get_ohlcv,
                              market_snapshot, annotate_chart, render_chart)
                              + the indicator library
        │  consumes
        ▼
@dsh-trading/market-data      the seam: ctx.marketData — typed candle/symbol interface
        ▲  implements
        │
@dsh-trading/provider-csv     reference provider: local CSV files
@dsh-trading/provider-futu    live provider: HK / US / A-share equities and
                              24/7 crypto pairs, from a local Futu OpenD

@dsh-trading/risk-guard       independent: refuses execution-shaped tool names
                              from any plugin, at dsh's tools/pre-execute gate

@dsh-trading/verdict          the evaluation harness: audit_backtest validates
                              fills against real candles, runs a seeded
                              random baseline and sample-size power check;
                              lint_strategy_code hunts lookahead leaks.
                              Verdicts may honestly be NOT PROVEN.

@dsh-trading/client-chart     web-only cards + the persistent chart column and
                              the loopback channel that feeds it; host-side,
                              the get_chart_view tool and the per-turn
                              context line that let the agent read that column
        │  fills the chart seat of
        ▼
@dsh-trading/client-frame     web-only: the shell frame. Replaces dsh's stock
                              three-column layout row with a chart-first one —
                              sidebar | chart | conversation | details,
                              70/30 by default with the sidebar railed — and
                              declares the `trading.chart` seat
```

- **`market-data`** defines the seam and nothing else (its only peer is cordis). Every consumer talks to `ctx.marketData`; every data source hides behind `MarketDataProvider`.
- **`provider-csv`** is the *bring-your-own-data* template: ~100 lines, local `<root>/<symbol>/<timeframe>.csv` files. Copy it to put ClickHouse, a broker API, or CCXT behind the same interface — tools upstream never change.
- **`provider-futu`** is that template filled in against a real broker gateway: HK / US / A-share equities and crypto pairs (`CC.BTCUSDT`), the last being the only instrument that keeps moving at 3am, which makes it the honest way to check that "live" is live. It reads `Qot_GetKL` rather than `Qot_RequestHistoryKL` on purpose: GetKL rides the subscription quota and serves the most recent bars (≤1000), while RequestHistoryKL spends a scarce historical quota OpenD rations by account assets. The trade is stated in the provider's own `description` and honoured in its behaviour — `start` / `end` **filter** the fetched window, they do not seek, so a query for an older range returns honestly empty rather than quietly wrong. See [Live data](#live-data-futu-opend) for setup; note that OpenD is an account-bound personal gateway, which is a licensing fact, not a configuration one.

  `futu-api` is a **peer** dependency, deliberately unpinned. The SDK's version is coupled to the OpenD *you* have installed, not to this package, and Futu states outright that its package versions follow its own scheme rather than semver — so no range expresses "compatible" and the two must be aligned by hand. Install the `futu-api` matching your OpenD (`10.9.x` SDK for a `10.9.x` OpenD). The provider checks this itself at connect, via `GetGlobalState`, and logs a warning naming both versions if the protocol lines differ — a skew otherwise surfaces as a rejected handshake or an empty decode, with nothing to point at.
- **`tool-market`** registers read-only analysis tools on `ctx.tools`. `market_snapshot` returns a whole multi-timeframe indicator regime in one call (RSI, slow stochastic, ADX/DI, MACD, MFI, ATR, SMA/EMA posture, Bollinger) with coarse state labels; `get_ohlcv` serves raw bars when structure matters. The indicator math is pure and deterministic — textbook definitions with Wilder smoothing where Wilder defined it — so values reconcile against any charting platform and a session-log replay recomputes identical model-visible numbers.
- **`client-chart`** draws the charts, and drives them from two independent ends. The model's `market_snapshot` / `annotate_chart` results render as cards through the `tool.call.toolview` seam. The USER drives the persistent column directly: a symbol box and timeframe row talk to `ctx.marketData` over a loopback RPC channel the package's host half publishes. That second path is the point — a workbench whose only input is "hope the agent calls the right tool" stops working the moment the agent would rather chat, which is exactly what happens in practice. The channel exposes the two read verbs of `MarketDataProvider` plus one write that only records what the panel is showing; it never touches the tool layer, so risk-guard's execution gate is neither weakened nor bypassed.

  The column **follows the conversation rather than mirroring it**. When the agent charts an instrument the panel loads that symbol and timeframe *for itself* — adopting the agent's payload verbatim would pin a frozen ≤200-bar snapshot on screen, which is precisely the "why isn't it moving?" bug this replaced. It refuses to refetch a series it already holds (one analysis calls `annotate_chart` dozens of times on the same chart), and a **pinned** column stops following entirely: the agent's chart becomes a `Show` offer on a pill, not a takeover mid-read. The decision is a pure function with its own test suite, because a policy buried in a `useEffect` is a policy nobody can pin.

  Marks ride separately from candles. The agent's drawings are matched to the panel's series by a strict predicate — same instrument, same timeframe, prices inside the visible range — so a level drawn on the 1h chart never silently appears on the 5m one, and marks that fall outside are reported as dropped rather than clamped. They survive a reload via per-tab `sessionStorage`, since the card that published them may be virtualized away by the time the page comes back. Captions are laid out in three lanes with a minimum gap so ten levels inside a narrow band read as ten levels instead of one smear; past three collisions the line still draws and the caption is dropped.

  The panel also **publishes what it is showing** back to the host, and the host feeds that to the model two ways: a one-line context injection each turn, and a `get_chart_view` tool for the same facts on demand. This closes a loop that was conspicuously open — the panel's data path bypasses the tool layer by design, so nothing about the user's chart reached the agent on its own, and the agent would ask the user to screenshot a chart it was rendering two columns away. The injection costs nothing while the panel is idle (empty text is no contribution), the published value is validated on arrival (it lands in a model's context, which makes it a prompt-injection surface as much as a correctness one), and it expires after 30s so an abandoned second tab cannot make the model confidently name the wrong symbol.

  The chart stays **live**: it re-reads the last few bars once a second and merges them by open time, so a forming bar is replaced in place and a new one is appended — append blindly and a live chart grows a duplicate candle every poll. Updates go through `updateData` on the existing plot rather than a rebuild, so the canvas never flickers. A poll rather than a push, deliberately: the host channel is unary, and a chart seconds old is worth far less engineering than a streaming transport. When the tape stops moving — eight polls that taught it nothing — the panel backs off to once every five seconds and springs back the moment a bar moves, which is cheaper and more honest than shipping a market calendar. A hidden tab backs off the same way rather than stopping: some embedded browsers report `hidden` while the user is plainly watching, and a kill-switch there is indistinguishable from the bug it looks like.
- **`client-frame`** is the layout half of the same row-swap idea. dsh's shell is one plugin row (`ui-layout`) that occupies the built-in `root` slot and declares the `sidebar` / `conversation` / `details` / `shell.overlay` seats inside it. Slot core permits exactly **one declarer per seat**, so a frame cannot sit beside the stock one — the bundle disables that row and inserts ours, which re-declares those four seats *under the same names*. `ui-sidebar` and `ui-conversation` register by name, so dsh's real sidebar and its real conversation surface mount into a third-party frame unchanged; we only decide the column order. On top of them it adds a fifth seat, `trading.chart`, for the persistent chart column.

  Its defaults differ from the stock shell on purpose. The chart takes **70% of the free width** and the conversation 30 — stored as a *ratio*, not a pixel width, because "the chart takes 70%" has to survive a window resize to mean anything. The conversation floor drops from dsh's 640px to 420, since here it is a side column rather than the whole app; holding 640 would make the split impossible on a laptop. The sidebar starts collapsed to its rail: a permanent session-history column is a poor trade against chart width, so the frame contributes a session switcher to `conversation.session.header.utilities` instead — the route to your sessions lives in the conversation's own top-right, next to the thing it switches. No fork, no patched core — the same mechanism as swapping `market-data-provider`.

  **Opt-in, not bundled.** This row is deliberately absent from `@dsh-trading/bundle`: replacing the whole shell is far too opinionated to impose on everyone who installs the bundle. Add it from your own profile patch when you want it:

  ```yaml
  - id: ui-layout
    disabled: true

  - insert:
      - id: trading-frame
        name: '@dsh-trading/client-frame'
  ```
- **`bundle/trading`** wires six rows into a dsh profile via `cordis.patch.yml`: `market-data`, `market-data-provider`, `tool-market`, `verdict`, `risk-guard`, `client-chart`. Users repoint or replace the `market-data-provider` row from their own profile patch — that row swap **is** the BYO mechanism. The shell frame and the Futu provider are deliberately *not* among those rows; see above for the lines that enable each.

## Why this and not another finance plugin?

Data plugins hard-wire one source; dsh-trading defines the seam they can all plug
into. Quant toolkits ship one tool per indicator; `market_snapshot` returns the
whole multi-timeframe regime in one call, with state labels computed from the
rounded reported values so chart and number never disagree. And everyone else's
"research only" is a README sentence — ours is a `tools/pre-execute` gate you can
test.

## Hard boundary: research only

This project deliberately has **no order-execution capability and no execution seam**. Tools read data and compute; nothing places, routes, or simulates-then-forwards orders. Contributions adding live trading execution are out of scope. Nothing here is investment advice.

`@dsh-trading/risk-guard` extends that stance over plugins this project does not ship: it refuses order-execution and fund-movement tool names at dsh's `tools/pre-execute` gate, so mounting a broker plugin in a `trading` profile does not quietly gain the ability to trade. Name matching is a heuristic and cannot be complete — the guard is defense in depth, not the guarantee. The guarantee is structural: there is no execution seam to reach.

## Data format (CSV provider)

```
data/
  AAPL/
    1d.csv        # header: time,open,high,low,close,volume
  BTC-USDT/
    1h.csv        # ISO-8601 UTC bar-open times, ascending
```

## Try it with dsh

One command — the published bundle pulls its six plugin rows from npm
(`client-frame` and `provider-futu` are opt-in, see below):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile trading add @dsh-trading/bundle
```

<details>
<summary>Or from a checkout (for hacking on the packages)</summary>

Build, then compose the profile from local paths. dsh resolves plugin rows from
the profile directory, so **every package the bundle's patch names must be
linked alongside it** — miss one and that row fails to resolve at boot:

```sh
pnpm install && pnpm build
node examples/generate-sample-data.mjs

dsh plugin --profile trading add ./bundle/trading \
    ./packages/market-data ./packages/provider-csv ./packages/tool-market \
    ./packages/verdict ./packages/risk-guard ./packages/client-chart
```

Add `./packages/client-frame` and `./packages/provider-futu` to that list if
you intend to enable the chart-first shell or live Futu data.

</details>

Add `"@deepseek-ai/dsh-headless"` (or `"@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app"`) after
`@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` in the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` list
(`$DSH_HOME/profiles/trading/package.json`) to pick a surface, configure a model
key (environment `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, or the Models page under `dsh web`), and
run from any directory whose `./data` holds candles in the layout above:

```sh
cd examples && dsh --profile trading "pull DEMO-EQ daily candles with sma20/sma50 and describe the trend"
```

Verify the composed layers any time with `dsh --profile trading --dump-config`.

### Live data: Futu OpenD

Install and run [Futu OpenD](https://openapi.futunn.com/futu-api-doc/) with its
**websocket** listener enabled — that is a separate port from `api_port`, and
`websocket_key_md5` is **mandatory** for JavaScript clients (without it OpenD
answers the handshake with a bare `retType: -1` and no message). In
`OpenD.xml` / `OpenD.ini`:

```ini
websocket_port = 33333
websocket_key_md5 = <md5 of your key>
```

Then install the matching SDK and repoint the provider row from your profile's
`cordis.patch.yml`:

```sh
npm i futu-api@10.9   # must match your OpenD's version line
```

```yaml
- id: market-data-provider
  name: '@dsh-trading/provider-futu'
  config:
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 33333       # the websocket port — NOT api_port (11111)
    symbols:
      - CC.BTCUSDT    # crypto: the one that moves 24/7
      - HK.00700
      - US.MU
```

`symbols` is the catalogue `list_symbols` reports; any symbol OpenD knows can
still be typed straight into the chart column.

### The Market Analyst preset

`presets/analyst/` is an agent preset that turns the raw tools into a structured
analysis workflow: it scopes the request first (horizon, focus, timeframes),
then reports higher-timeframe context, a key-level table, the multi-timeframe
indicator regime with conflicts named rather than averaged away, bull and bear
scenarios with triggers and invalidation, and the levels that resolve the
ambiguity. Install it and pick **Market Analyst** in the session's preset menu:

```sh
DSH="${DSH_HOME:-$HOME/.dsh}"
mkdir -p "$DSH/.agent-presets" && cp -r presets/analyst "$DSH/.agent-presets/"
```

The persona holds the research boundary in prose the way `risk-guard` holds it
in code: report what the data shows, never recommend a position or an entry.
It also decides *where* an analysis lands — `annotate_chart` draws on the
reader's live column, and `render_chart` is reserved for exporting an image
file. Getting that one paragraph wrong is what put drawings in the chat feed
instead of on the chart.

### Chart cards in `dsh web`

Under the `web` surface, `market_snapshot` and `get_ohlcv` results render as
interactive candlestick cards (`@dsh-trading/client-chart`): K-line + volume +
SMA20/50/200, timeframe tabs, and a chip strip that both shows the exact
indicator values the model read and toggles panes for them (RSI, slow
stochastic, ADX/DI, MACD, MFI, plus Bollinger as a price overlay). Every pane
is plotted from the *same per-bar series the model was given*, not recomputed
in the browser — which is why the card can never contradict the analysis text
beside it. The chart data rides the durable `tool/result` event's presentation
metadata: it never enters the model's context (zero token cost) and it replays
with the session log.

The card renderers are web-only; under a headless profile dsh falls back to the
generic text card and the loopback channel never appears. The host half is not
inert there, though — `get_chart_view` and the per-turn context line register
wherever `ctx.tools` and `ctx.systemPrompt` exist, and simply report a closed
panel.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm typecheck
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

## Roadmap

- [x] Profile template + docs for stacking onto `dsh --profile web`
- [x] Chart cards in `dsh web` (`@dsh-trading/client-chart`): `market_snapshot` / `get_ohlcv` render as interactive candlesticks with chip-toggled indicator panes
- [x] `annotate_chart`: model-authored levels/zones/paths with mandatory provenance and a hard price-range gate, plus base/alternative scenarios — rendered on the card with a levels table
- [x] Open contracts for ecosystem builders ([CONTRACTS.md](./CONTRACTS.md)): chart payload, open annotation envelope, pure-renderer registry
- [x] Chart-first shell (`@dsh-trading/client-frame`) and a persistent live column the user drives, with the agent's drawings landing on it
- [ ] Chart panel deepening: user-drawing feedback to the agent, `@Remote` host service for pan-back data
- [ ] Watch/alert contract (notify-only), `@dsh-trading/contracts` package, conformance fixtures
- [ ] Research-journal session events (hypotheses, signals — replayable)
- [ ] Deterministic backtest runner as a `ctx.commands` CLI command (never model-executed)
- [ ] More providers: Parquet, ClickHouse, CCXT
