> A local development service console for DSH: discover listening ports, identify services related to the current conversation or workspace, and safely inspect, stop, or restart them.

Single-purpose plugin for the DeepSeek Harness web UI. When the model (or you) starts a local dev server (`npm run dev`, Vite, Next.js, Uvicorn, Express, Rust, …), Service Console shows it in one place: which ports it listens on, which command and working directory started it, whether it belongs to this conversation or workspace, and whether it is safe to stop or restart.

## Features

- **Discovery** — scans listening TCP ports and correlates PID, PPID, command, working directory, process group and start time (macOS/Linux).
- **Ownership & risk** — five-level attribution: `This chat` (matched against the session launch ledger), `Workspace`, `Other local`, `Unknown`, `Protected`.
- **Control** — graceful stop to the process group, restart with a safe saved launch command. Every action is confirmed twice and re-validated against the current snapshot.
- **Safeguards** — PID-reuse / fingerprint checks before any signal; unknown and protected services are read-only; force-kill is off by default; no implicit auto-cleanup; command output is redacted.
- **All local services** — every listening service on this machine is visible; ownership is shown as a safety signal rather than a hidden category filter.
- **Search, config, i18n** — keyword filtering, graceful timeout / force-kill settings, and automatic Chinese/English labels from DSH's active locale.
- **On-demand scanning** — opening the console fetches the current snapshot once; use the refresh button for an explicit rescan. There is no background polling.
- **DSH-native inspector** — an expanded service record card presents process identity, ports, command, working directory and ownership evidence in the Web UI's token-based visual language.

## Install

Native package (recommended):

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add -w @jiyr0119/dsh-service-console@latest
```

Then refresh the DSH web UI — a `🖥 SC` entry appears in the conversation header and opens the console panel.

> Note: a plugin being listed in dsh-market/awesome does not mean its UI auto-appears — this package ships both Host routes and a browser bundle, so after `dsh plugin add` the panel is present. Works on macOS / Linux; Windows is not supported yet.

Alternative — dynamic paste (zero-build, process-local): paste `dynamic/host.js` + `dynamic/client.js` via the dynamic Cordis plugin flow.

## UI preview

![Service Console 0.2.0 — all local services and DSH-style inspector](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jiyr0119/dsh-service-console/643ab1b6ccc5a578f215407404f901cab95f6ca7/assets/service-console-0.2.0.gif)

The preview shows the complete local listening-service list and the expanded inspector card. The ownership badge remains visible as a safety signal, while the list itself is no longer split into conversation/workspace/machine categories.

**[→ Interactive Demo](./demo/index.html)** — try the Service Console UI in your browser (no installation required).

## Permissions & safety

- The client never sends raw PIDs or shell commands; it targets a service ID and the Host re-validates PID / start time / fingerprint before acting.
- Graceful termination first (SIGTERM to the process group); SIGKILL only when explicitly enabled and confirmed.
- Sensitive tokens/passwords in command summaries are redacted.
- This plugin is **not** a general process manager: system-critical, high-privilege, unknown and protected processes are read-only.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm test          # unit + integration tests (node --test)
```

## Testing

`npm test` builds once and runs the whole suite with Node's built-in test runner (`node --test`). No extra test framework is required.

| File | Type | What it covers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `test/process-inspector.test.mjs` | Unit | Platform output parsing (`parseLstart`, `parseListenRows`, `parsePsRows`, `parseAddress`), command redaction, five-level ownership classification |
| `test/host-more.test.mjs` | Unit | Config validation, session ledger, lifecycle state machine (stop/restart) with fake dependencies, service aggregation & fingerprint stability |
| `test/integration.test.mjs` | Integration | Real system commands + a temporary HTTP server spawned by the test itself; signals are only ever sent to test-owned processes |

```bash
npm test                                   # full suite
npm run build && node --test test/process-inspector.test.mjs   # run a single file
```

Unit tests import the built output under `lib/`, so the sources must be compiled first — `npm test` handles this automatically.
