Some tasks are awkward in text. DeepSeek Harness GenUI lets an Agent create a focused interface for the current task: something that explains a difficult relationship or collects a complex user response.

The plugin is code-first. The Coding Agent writes ordinary React + TypeScript, not a component-tree DSL or IR. The interface can save what the user selected, entered, or changed so the next Agent turn can read it and continue the task.

## When an Interface Helps

Use an interface when the user needs to see a difficult relationship or make several connected choices. Plain questions, rewriting, summaries, and simple lists stay in prose.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Pick calendar slots</strong><br><br>Turn candidate availability into a short list of useful 90-minute writing blocks.<br><br>The interface saves the three choices to the task. A later calendar action remains separate and asks for approval.</td>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengyue-polaron/deepseek-harness-genui/dc8471382c404fea873e11c947a4ef12b6ee4698/screenshots/en/calendar-planner.jpg" width="280" alt="English interface for choosing three writing slots"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Explore photosynthesis</strong><br><br>Move light, carbon dioxide, temperature, and stomatal controls to find the limiting step.<br><br>The diagram changes with the controls, making each variable's effect easier to explore than to describe.</td>

  </tr>

## Inline & Canvas

The same app can sit inside the answer or open beside the conversation.

| Inline | Canvas |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengyue-polaron/deepseek-harness-genui/dc8471382c404fea873e11c947a4ef12b6ee4698/screenshots/en/code-path-inline.jpg" width="620" alt="An interactive code path shown inline in a DeepSeek Harness conversation"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengyue-polaron/deepseek-harness-genui/dc8471382c404fea873e11c947a4ef12b6ee4698/screenshots/en/code-path-canvas.jpg" width="620" alt="The DeepSeek Harness sidebar, conversation, and code-path explorer visible together in the right-side Canvas"> |
| A compact control or focused choice. | More room without covering the conversation. |

Inline, Canvas, fullscreen, and CLI/localhost are different surfaces over the same task state. Selections and inputs saved in one surface remain available to later Agent turns.

## CLI Example

The terminal profile returns a localhost app. A follow-up can refer to the path already selected in that app.

```text
❯ Explain how a generated app reaches the permission-gated runtime in this
  repository. Build an interactive code-path explorer and return a localhost URL.

  I mapped src/tools.ts → src/artifacts/builder.ts → src/runtime/server.ts
  → src/artifacts/registry.ts.

  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/genui/app/<task-app>

❯ Where does the path I selected stop?

  It reaches the permission check in src/runtime/server.ts, then stops before
  the connected tool runs because access has not been allowed.
```

## How It Works

1. The Agent writes ordinary React + TypeScript and the plugin builds and checks it.
2. The interface saves semantic values—selections, form answers, drafts, and progress—to the current task. A follow-up can read those values instead of asking the user to repeat them.
3. The app declares only the Harness/MCP/Skill tools or credential-free public HTTPS routes it needs. Before opening a connected app, Harness presents the complete access list for one task-scoped decision; changed capabilities are shown again, and undeclared calls are blocked.
4. Later edits update the same app. A failed update never replaces the current working version.

In Web, access can be reviewed or revoked from the app card. MCP credentials never enter generated code.

## Why Code-First

Most generative UI systems ask developers to prebuild widgets or maintain a trusted component catalog. This plugin lets the Coding Agent build task-specific React instead. The generated code still runs inside a sandbox, meaningful user state stays with the task, connected actions remain permission-gated, and a failed update never replaces the last working version.

That makes GenUI more expressive than a fixed component catalog, but deliberately narrower than a cross-client UI protocol: it is built for DeepSeek Harness and its task lifecycle.

## Task Apps or Component Trees?

Both approaches are useful, but they optimize for different work:

| Choose a component-schema renderer when... | Choose this plugin when... |
| --- | --- |
| The result is a compact card, table, chart, or form assembled from a known catalog. | The task needs a purpose-built React app whose structure and interactions are not known in advance. |
| Small, predictable model output and portable rendering matter most. | Free-form simulations, spatial tools, connected workflows, or multi-step state matter most. |
| An interaction can be represented as a component event. | The user's selections and edits need to become task state that the next Agent turn can read. |

This project does not replace lightweight `dsh-ui` component renderers. It covers the code-first, task-specific side of GenUI.

## DESIGN.md

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration** to set the default design for new apps. Choose automatic selection or a built-in profile, import a custom `DESIGN.md`, or export the selected one as a starting point. Once selected, it becomes the default for apps created later, so the style does not need to be repeated in every prompt. Existing apps keep their original design.

`DESIGN.md` controls the design language, not the page structure. React + TypeScript remains free to implement simulations, graphics, maps, timelines, code graphs, animation, and irregular layouts.

| Design | Visual language |
| --- | --- |
| `material-3` | Google Material 3: tonal surfaces, expressive color, clear hierarchy, and touch-friendly controls |
| `apple-human-interface` | Apple Human Interface: calm, precise, content-led, and familiar system-like controls |
| `shadcn-ui` | shadcn/ui: semantic tokens, crisp borders, compact forms, and complete interaction states |

## Install

Use Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24`. The plugin supports DeepSeek Harness `^0.1.0-rc.6`.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-genui
dsh --profile web
```

The Web profile supports Inline, Canvas, fullscreen, and localhost links. For a terminal profile, replace `web` with `tui`; TUI returns localhost links and does not embed Canvas. Connect MCP servers to the same profile as usual.

The plugin does not download or launch a browser. Every candidate is compiled and checked against the source contracts before it can replace the last working version. The repository CI separately exercises the sandboxed runtime in Chromium; plugin users do not need it.

## Try It in Two Minutes

Start a new Web session and paste one of these prompts:

```text
Plan a Saturday route with a museum, a riverside garden, and dinner. Build an
interface where I can change the times and make the garden optional.
```

```text
Trace how a generated app reaches the permission-gated runtime in this
repository. Build an interactive code-path explorer grounded in the source.
```

```text
Build an interactive double-slit experiment. Let me change wavelength, slit
spacing, and screen distance and see the interference pattern update.
```

After changing and saving something in the interface, ask:

```text
What did I just choose in the interface? Continue from the saved result.
```

The useful proof is not only that an interface appears—it is that the next Agent turn can continue from the interaction.

## Safety

Generated code runs in a sandbox. Direct API requests are limited to declared, credential-free public HTTPS routes. Temporary links and grants expire after 7 days; saved task state expires 7 days after its last update. Return to the app card in the task to review or remove access.

The plugin uses DeepSeek Harness + Cordis, React 18 + TypeScript, and esbuild. Repository tests use Playwright and Vitest.

## Development

Building from source requires pnpm 11.

Chromium is needed only to run the repository's browser end-to-end tests. It is not installed or launched by the plugin.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm run package:plugin
```
