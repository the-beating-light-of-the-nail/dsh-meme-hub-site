Some tasks are awkward in text. DeepSeek Harness GenUI lets an Agent create a focused interface for the current task: something that explains a difficult relationship or collects a complex user response.

The plugin is code-first. The Coding Agent writes ordinary React + TypeScript, not a component-tree DSL or IR. The interface can save what the user selected, entered, or changed so the next Agent turn can read it and continue the task.

## When an Interface Helps

Use an interface when the user needs to see a difficult relationship or make several connected choices. Plain questions, rewriting, summaries, and simple lists stay in prose.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Pick calendar slots</strong><br><br>Turn candidate availability into a short list of useful 90-minute writing blocks.<br><br>The interface saves the three choices to the task. A later calendar action remains separate and asks for approval.</td>
    <td><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengyue-polaron/deepseek-harness-genui/666076819ab2eae0f6f06980e99c013f89fb6b9f/screenshots/en/calendar-planner.jpg" width="280" alt="English interface for choosing three writing slots"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Explore photosynthesis</strong><br><br>Move light, carbon dioxide, temperature, and stomatal controls to find the limiting step.<br><br>The diagram changes with the controls, making each variable's effect easier to explore than to describe.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Trace a code path</strong><br><br>Ask from the CLI for a source-grounded explanation of a real project flow.<br><br>The result is a local explorer with files, functions, branches, and the path selected by the user.</td>

## Inline & Canvas

The same app can sit inside the answer or open beside the conversation.

| Inline | Canvas |
| --- | --- |
| <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengyue-polaron/deepseek-harness-genui/666076819ab2eae0f6f06980e99c013f89fb6b9f/screenshots/en/code-path-inline.jpg" width="620" alt="An interactive code path shown inline in a DeepSeek Harness conversation"> | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pengyue-polaron/deepseek-harness-genui/666076819ab2eae0f6f06980e99c013f89fb6b9f/screenshots/en/code-path-canvas.jpg" width="620" alt="The DeepSeek Harness sidebar, conversation, and code-path explorer visible together in the right-side Canvas"> |
| A compact control or focused choice. | More room without covering the conversation. |

Inline, Canvas, fullscreen, and CLI/localhost are different surfaces over the same task state. Selections and inputs saved in one surface remain available to later Agent turns.

## CLI Example

The Web profile can return a localhost app when a prompt explicitly asks for a local link. A follow-up can refer to the path already selected in that app.

```text
❯ Explain how a generated app reaches the permission-gated runtime in this
  repository. Build an interactive code-path explorer and return a localhost URL.

  I mapped src/tools.ts → src/artifacts/builder.ts → src/runtime/server.ts
  → src/artifacts/registry.ts.

  http://127.0.0.1:<port>/genui/app/<task-app>

❯ Where does the path I selected stop?

  It reaches the permission check in src/runtime/server.ts, then stops before
  the connected tool runs because access has not been allowed.
```

## How It Works

1. The Agent writes ordinary React + TypeScript and the plugin builds and checks it.
2. The interface saves semantic values—selections, form answers, drafts, and progress—to the current task. A follow-up can read those values instead of asking the user to repeat them.
3. The app declares only the Harness/MCP/Skill tools or credential-free public HTTPS routes it needs. Before opening a connected app, Harness presents the complete access list for one task-scoped decision; changed capabilities are shown again, and undeclared calls are blocked.
4. Later edits update the same app. A candidate that fails the build or source-contract gate does not replace the current ready version. If the active sandbox reports a startup crash, the plugin quarantines that version and restores the newest ready version when one exists.

In Web, access can be reviewed or revoked from the app card. MCP credentials and the task capability token never enter generated code.

## Why Code-First

Most generative UI systems ask developers to prebuild widgets or maintain a trusted component catalog. This plugin lets the Coding Agent build task-specific React instead. The generated code still runs inside a sandbox, meaningful user state stays with the task, connected actions remain permission-gated, and a failed update never replaces the last working version.

That makes GenUI more expressive than a fixed component catalog, but deliberately narrower than a cross-client UI protocol: it is built for DeepSeek Harness and its task lifecycle.

## Task Apps or Component Trees?

Both approaches are useful, but they optimize for different work:

| Choose a component-schema renderer when... | Choose this plugin when... |
| --- | --- |
| The result is a compact card, table, chart, or form assembled from a known catalog. | The task needs a purpose-built React app whose structure and interactions are not known in advance. |
| Small, predictable model output and portable rendering matter most. | Free-form simulations, spatial tools, connected workflows, or multi-step state matter most. |
| An interaction can be represented as a component event. | The user's selections and edits need to become task state that the next Agent turn can read. |

This project does not replace lightweight `dsh-ui` component renderers. It covers the code-first, task-specific side of GenUI.

Related projects make different, useful trade-offs:

| Approach | Best fit | Where this plugin differs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`dsh-genui`](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-genui) | Predictable cards, tables, charts, and forms assembled from a constrained component catalog. | The Agent can write an arbitrary task-specific React app, and explicitly saved semantic state is available to the next Agent turn across Inline, Canvas, fullscreen, and localhost. |
| [`dsh-visualize`](https://github.com/Nagi-ovo/dsh-visualize) | Lightweight HTML visualizations inside DeepSeek Harness Web. | This plugin adds a task-app lifecycle, state handoff, connected capabilities, and localhost delivery from the supported Web profile. |
| [A2UI](https://a2ui.org/introduction/what-is-a2ui/) / [MCP Apps](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/extensions/apps/overview) | Cross-platform declarative UI or reusable server-owned app resources. | This plugin is intentionally DeepSeek Harness-specific and generates code for the current task instead of defining a cross-client protocol. |

Component catalogs are usually the better choice for small, predictable output; cross-client protocols are the better choice for portability. This plugin's strongest case is a structure that cannot be known in advance and whose saved result needs to continue the same Harness task.

## DESIGN.md

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration** to set the default design for new apps. Choose automatic selection or a built-in profile, import a custom `DESIGN.md`, or export the selected one as a starting point. Once selected, it becomes the default for apps created later, so the style does not need to be repeated in every prompt. Existing apps keep their original design.

`DESIGN.md` controls the design language, not the page structure. React + TypeScript remains free to implement simulations, graphics, maps, timelines, code graphs, animation, and irregular layouts.

| Design | Visual language |
| --- | --- |
| `material-3` | Google Material 3: tonal surfaces, expressive color, clear hierarchy, and touch-friendly controls |
| `apple-human-interface` | Apple Human Interface: calm, precise, content-led, and familiar system-like controls |
| `shadcn-ui` | shadcn/ui: semantic tokens, crisp borders, compact forms, and complete interaction states |

## Install

Use Node.js `^22.19.0 || ^24.0.0`. The supported and tested DeepSeek Harness range is `0.1.0-rc.6` through `0.1.0-rc.8`, plus `0.1.1-rc.1` through `0.1.1-rc.2`. The newer `0.1.2` alpha line is not included in the v0.14 compatibility promise.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-genui --allow-build=esbuild
dsh --profile web
```

To upgrade an existing Web profile after reviewing the release notes, run:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-genui@0.14.0 --save-exact --allow-build=esbuild
```

The v0.14 compatibility gate starts from a real v0.13.2 installation and checks that existing apps, semantic task state, grants, and version references remain readable. It does not claim compatibility with every unreleased or older historical build.

The supported surface is the Web profile, including Inline, Canvas, fullscreen, and localhost links. TUI/headless profiles are not supported in v0.14 because the plugin requires the Web host service. Connect MCP servers to the same Web profile as usual.

`--allow-build=esbuild` approves esbuild's platform-native local compiler setup. It does not install, download, launch, or depend on Chrome or Chromium. Every candidate is compiled and checked against the source contracts before it can replace the last working version. The repository CI separately exercises the sandboxed runtime in Chromium; plugin users do not need it.

## Try It in Two Minutes

Start a new Web session and paste one of these prompts:

```text
Plan a Saturday route with a museum, a riverside garden, and dinner. Build an
interface where I can change the times and make the garden optional.
```

```text
Trace how a generated app reaches the permission-gated runtime in this
repository. Build an interactive code-path explorer grounded in the source.
```

```text
Build an interactive double-slit experiment. Let me change wavelength, slit
spacing, and screen distance and see the interference pattern update.
```

After changing and saving something in the interface, ask:

```text
What did I just choose in the interface? Continue from the saved result.
```

The useful proof is not only that an interface appears—it is that the next Agent turn can continue from the interaction.

## Safety

Generated code runs in an opaque-origin sandbox. A trusted parent keeps the real task capability token and brokers only state, declared tools, and declared credential-free public HTTPS routes; the generated frame receives no usable bearer token. Temporary links and grants expire after 7 days, and saved task state expires 7 days after its last update. Return to the app card in the task to review or remove access.

This boundary protects host credentials and capabilities, but it cannot make deliberately malicious code safe to trust with data that the user has already authorized it to read. Source checks and CSP are defense in depth. Do not put secrets in generated-app state or grant access to data the app should not display; see [Security](SECURITY.md) for the precise threat model.

The plugin uses DeepSeek Harness + Cordis, React 18 + TypeScript, and esbuild. Repository tests use Playwright and Vitest.

## Development

Building from source requires pnpm 11. Type-checking and building do not need a separately installed browser:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run build
```

Maintainers running the deterministic browser E2E suite install Playwright's isolated test Chromium separately. This is CI/test tooling only and is not part of the plugin package or user installation:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright install chromium
pnpm test
pnpm run package:plugin
pnpm run verify:clean-install
pnpm run verify:upgrade
```

One public Open-Meteo scenario is intentionally opt-in so ordinary CI does not depend on an external service: `GENUI_LIVE_E2E=1 pnpm exec vitest run tests/browser-verifier.e2e.spec.ts`.
