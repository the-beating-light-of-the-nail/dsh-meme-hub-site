# BailingHub for DeepSeek Harness

[简体中文](docs/README.zh-CN.md) | English

Use your local DeepSeek Harness Agent to operate the admin side of an online store, SaaS product,
or other business system through BailingHub. Ask it to look up data, update records, or run other
actions available to the connected account. The existing business identity, permissions, and
approval rules still apply, and BailingHub keeps the authorization and action trail.

For example, depending on what the connected business system has exposed, you can ask the local
Agent to:

- find an order, customer, product, or employee record;
- update an allowed field or business status;
- run another permitted admin action;
- return the result while BailingHub records the corresponding tool steps.

Reasoning and tool orchestration stay in DSH. BailingHub supplies the authorized business context,
available capabilities, approval state, invocation recovery, and audit records required for the
local Agent to act safely.

This is an independent community integration. It is not developed, certified, endorsed, or
recommended by DeepSeek.

> **Current stable line:** `dsh-bailinghub@0.2.0` uses the native Agent Client flow documented
> below. Public `0.1.1` remains available only as the explicit static MCP compatibility path.

For the shortest end-user path, follow the [three-minute getting started guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).

## How the 0.2 Agent Client fits together

```text
DeepSeek Harness local Agent
  -> dsh-bailinghub native Cordis adapter
  -> bailinghub-mcp-server/sdk
  -> BailingHub Agent Auth + Agent API
  -> operator-selected business integration and final authorization
```

The packages have separate responsibilities:

- **BailingHub Core** owns Agent Auth, trusted business identity, runtime context, knowledge and
  memory projection, capability governance, approvals, invocation state, and audit records.
- **`bailinghub-mcp-server/sdk`** owns browser login, PKCE, credential storage, refresh,
  Hub/client/workspace connection isolation, and HTTP DTO mapping.
- **`dsh-bailinghub`** owns only DSH session, prompt, command, and dynamic-tool lifecycle
  integration. It does not store credentials or call a business API directly.

This Agent Client is not the BailingHub executor. The executor receives jobs from the Hub for
work that must run near a machine; the Agent Client keeps the interactive reasoning loop on the
user's local DSH Agent.

## Before installing

The deployer and business integrator must prepare these public identifiers in BailingHub:

1. A reachable HTTPS BailingHub deployment with the matching Agent Auth and Agent API contracts.
2. A public Agent Client application id (`clientAppId`).
3. At least one authorized workspace. In Agent Client v1, the workspace id is the BailingHub
   route id.
4. A business authorization page and governed ACC/Tool Provider integration behind that route.

The end user does **not** enter a business API URL, business login credential, Tool Provider
signing secret, BailingHub Client Token, or model-provider key into this plugin.

## Install the 0.2 line

Prerequisites:

- Node.js `22.19.0+` or `24+`;
- `pnpm` and DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.7`;
- the BailingHub preparation above.

Install the exact stable version into the DSH Web profile:

```bash
npm install --global pnpm @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.0-rc.7
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-bailinghub@0.2.0
```

`dsh-bailinghub@0.2.0` installs its exact compatible `bailinghub-mcp-server@0.2.0` dependency
automatically. DSH users should not separately guess or install an SDK version.

## Configure one Hub connection

The native plugin has exactly four host configuration fields:

| Plugin field | Environment value | Meaning | Secret |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `hubUrl` | `BAILINGHUB_HUB_URL` | Public HTTPS URL of the developer's own BailingHub | No |
| `clientAppId` | `BAILINGHUB_CLIENT_APP_ID` | Public Agent Client application id registered in that Hub | No |
| `workspace` | `BAILINGHUB_WORKSPACE` | Initial authorized workspace/route id | No |
| `connectionName` | `BAILINGHUB_CONNECTION_NAME` | Local alias for this isolated SDK connection | No |

Example placeholders:

```bash
export BAILINGHUB_HUB_URL='https://hub.example.com'
export BAILINGHUB_CLIENT_APP_ID='example-agent-client'
export BAILINGHUB_WORKSPACE='order_assistant'
export BAILINGHUB_CONNECTION_NAME='default'
```

The same four fields may be supplied through the DSH plugin settings surface. Do not add tokens,
authorization URLs, business domains, or credentials to the Cordis patch.

Inspect the composed profile before starting it:

```bash
dsh --profile web --dump-config
dsh web
```

## Authorize and use the local Agent

In DSH, run:

```text
/bailinghub login
/bailinghub status
/bailinghub workspaces
```

`login` opens the system browser. The business-side authorization page confirms the signed-in
business identity and requested workspace, then returns to a random loopback callback protected
by `state` and PKCE S256. Access and refresh tokens remain in SDK-owned secure storage and are
never written to the plugin configuration or printed by the command.

Useful commands:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/bailinghub login` | Authorize the configured Hub/client/workspace in the browser |
| `/bailinghub status` | Inspect the selected connection without printing credentials |
| `/bailinghub workspaces` | List workspaces allowed by the current business authorization |
| `/bailinghub use <workspace>` | Select another already-authorized workspace for new sessions |
| `/bailinghub sync` | Retry a pending visible completion record without repeating a tool call |
| `/bailinghub logout` | Revoke and remove the selected Agent Session |

The standard v1 login requests only the configured workspace. `use` succeeds only when the
current Agent Session explicitly contains the target workspace; it is not permission to switch to
an arbitrary Hub route. The current command set always operates on this plugin instance's four
configured fields; it does not accept a connection selector. For another Hub or route, use a
second DSH profile/plugin instance, or edit those fields and reload the profile, set a different
`connectionName`, and complete browser authorization again.

For the first acceptance check, start a new DSH conversation and perform one read-only request,
then one permitted mutation. Confirm the same conversation, run, visible final answer, and tool
invocation trajectory appear in BailingHub. An approval-required capability must resume the
original invocation after approval; it must never create a replacement business call.

DSH Code Mode is deliberately degraded in this release because it cannot safely present the
current-turn dynamic schemas. Use native tool mode for governed business actions.

## Security and privacy boundary

- The model cannot choose a Hub URL, workspace, identity, credential, approval result, or
  capability revision through tool arguments.
- The SDK stores credentials in macOS Keychain. Linux and other POSIX systems require an explicit
  secure file-store opt-in; Windows Agent Session storage is not supported in 0.2.0.
- BailingHub revalidates identity, scope, approval, idempotency, and invocation state on every
  governed call. The downstream business system still performs final authorization.
- The adapter sends visible user input, governed tool arguments/results, and the visible final
  answer required by the Agent Client contracts. It never uploads hidden reasoning chunks.
- This plugin governs only the BailingHub tools it registers. It does not intercept unrelated DSH
  tools or model-provider traffic.

Review [Security](SECURITY.md), [Privacy](PRIVACY.md), the
[Agent Client contract](docs/AGENT_CLIENT_CONTRACT.md), and
[compatibility](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md) before production use.

## Legacy public 0.1.x static mode

Public `dsh-bailinghub@0.1.1` remains an immutable configuration-only bundle. It uses the in-box
DSH MCP Client to start `bailinghub-mcp-server@0.1.1`, binds one operator-provisioned Client Token
to one fixed route, and leaves orchestration in BailingHub.

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-bailinghub@0.1.1

export BAILINGHUB_BASE_URL='https://hub.example.com'
export BAILINGHUB_CLIENT_TOKEN='replace-with-a-route-scoped-client-token'
export BAILINGHUB_ROUTE='order_assistant'
```

It exposes exactly these three tools:

```text
mcp__bailinghub__submit_governed_job
mcp__bailinghub__get_governed_job
mcp__bailinghub__wait_for_governed_job
```

The 0.2 Agent Client does not automatically consume or migrate the 0.1 Client Token. Keep versions
explicit and follow the [0.1-to-0.2 migration boundary](docs/MIGRATION_VNEXT.md) when testing or
rolling back.

## Compatibility and feedback

Version 0.2.0 is verified only against the versions listed in
[docs/COMPATIBILITY.md](docs/COMPATIBILITY.md). DeepSeek Harness remains a developer preview, so
every Harness release requires a new native lifecycle smoke test.
