# dsh-biomemory · Biomimetic Memory for DeepSeek Harness

> [中文文档](README.zh-CN.md) · [English](README.md)

> **Version v0.6.0** · MIT License · **Compatibility**: DeepSeek Harness ≥ 0.1.1-rc.2 (current latest line; tested on 0.1.2-rc.1 too)

A cross-session memory plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH), designed like a human brain: layered memory, graded approval, memory metabolism, fully transparent.

**v0.6.0 (2026-08-31) — architecture refactor + session-end auto-consolidation:**

- **Modular architecture**: `index.mjs` slimmed to a wiring layer; business logic split into focused modules — `shared` (config/utils/audit/conflict), `store` (write/pin/remove/restore/migration), `retrieve` (query/semantic), `meta` (metabolism/reflect), `snapshot` (frozen snapshot/session consolidator), `gate` (approval/self-heal), `notify` (pet bubble), `session-state`. No behavior change; 57 tests green.
- **Session-end auto-consolidation**: after a turn ends (`turn/end` completed), the plugin injects a "consolidate this turn" directive into the next prompt assembly; the model then writes anything worth remembering via `memory add`. Cleared on write, 5-minute stale guard, deduplication respected.
- **Fix**: `package.json` `files` whitelist now includes all new modules (publishing without them would break consumers with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`); `/reflect` `/dream` endpoints read `dryRun` from the request body.

**v0.5.3 (2026-08-31) — UI modernization:**

- Settings page restyled with the "monumental visual" design language (warm paper-toned surfaces, accent gold line, rounded cards, focus rings) — no more default-blue look; peer deps bumped to `>=0.1.1-rc.1`.

**v0.5.2 (2026-08-20) — editable memories + conflict surfacing:**

- **Edit entries in place**: `memory action=update fp="..." text="..."` (tool), `/memory edit <fp> <new text>` (command) and an **Edit** button on the Knowledge tab — metadata (pin/weight/layer) is preserved, the stale vector is cleared, and an `UPDATE` audit event is recorded; duplicates are rejected.
- **Conflict surfacing**: behavior memories that clash with user preferences are **pinned to the top** of `memory action=list`, the Knowledge tab (red badge + left border) and the frozen session snapshot (marked `[冲突]`) — so conflicts float up for you to judge and fix, instead of being silently auto-arbitrated away. Search results keep relevance order but still carry the conflict marker.
- **Conflict arbitration in the Reflect tab**: conflicts are listed at the top of the reflect view, each with inline **Edit** (large auto-growing editor) and **Delete** buttons, plus an **Undo** bar after deletion.
- **Single-entry rollback**: `memory action=restore fp="..."` (tool), `/memory undo <fp>` (command), `POST /entries/restore` (API) restore a deleted entry from the newest backup DB — metadata preserved, `RESTORE` audit event recorded.
- **Reflect data source fixed to SQLite** (was scanning the Markdown read-only backups — deleted entries resurrected on the next reflect).

**v0.5.1 (2026-08-20) — pet bridge extracted:**

- The DSH↔desktop-pet bridge (session/event state forwarding + approval panel) moved out to its own plugin `dsh-whale-pet-bridge` — biomemory now only handles memory (save notifications to the pet are kept).
- No functional changes to memory features.

**v0.5 (2026-08-19) — SQLite + semantic retrieval:**

- **SQLite data layer** (`~/.dsh/biomemory/biomemory.db`, Node 24 built-in `node:sqlite`, WAL mode, zero external deps) — L2/L3 structured entries + vector blobs + audit log
- **Offline embedding model** (`bge-small-zh-v1.5`, 512-dim, quantized ONNX ~24MB at `~/.dsh/models/`) via transformers.js — pure JS, no native modules
- **Three retrieval modes**: `exact` (keyword) / `semantic` (vector) / `hybrid` (default, Reciprocal Rank Fusion per v0.5 design doc §3.4)
- **Automatic Markdown migration**: existing `~/.dsh/memory` entries imported once on first boot (Markdown kept as read-only backup)
- **Audit aggregation** (P1-003): group by action / day / entry
- **Dream checkpointing** (P0-002): resume interrupted metabolism from the last checkpoint
- Graceful degradation: model unavailable → keyword retrieval only; memory features unaffected

Core features (unchanged from v0.4):

- `memory` tool: add / query / update / remove / list / pin / unpin / dream / audit
- **Frozen snapshot injection** at session start (pinned memories and user preferences at top priority, then recent knowledge/behavior)
- **Graded approval gate**: important memories (preferences/decisions/lessons) require human approval; ordinary facts are auto-saved; fails closed when no approval channel is available
- `/memory` command: list / query / add / edit / remove / pin / unpin / dream / audit
- `memory_recall` tool: cross-session recall ("do you remember…" scenarios)
- Deduplication: content fingerprint skips duplicate entries
- **Memory metabolism** (`/memory dream`): half-life decay, reference consolidation, conflict arbitration, cold archiving (status flag, never deleted)
- **Memory pins**: lock a memory so it never decays and always enters the snapshot

## Install

```bash
# As a local bundle in a DSH profile
dsh plugin add dsh-biomemory
# Or pnpm local link
pnpm add link:./dsh-biomemory
```

Add `dsh-biomemory` to `dsh.profile.bundles` in the profile.

## Memory Layout

```
~/.dsh/memory/
├── preferences.md      # User/project preferences (top priority, frozen-injected)
├── hot/
│   ├── knowledge.md    # L1 recent knowledge (facts/decisions)
│   └── behavior.md     # L1 recent behavior (lessons/habits/workflows)
├── projects/<name>/    # L2 project archives
├── longterm/           # L3 long-term memory
├── archive/            # Memories archived by metabolism (decayed below threshold, never deleted)
├── backups/            # Automatic backups before dream runs (rollback source)
├── audit.log           # Human-readable audit (legacy, kept for compatibility)
└── audit.jsonl         # Structured audit (JSON Lines, v0.3)
```

Each entry is a single line: `- [knowledge|auto] [fp:xxx] [w:10] [h:3] [t:2026-08-16 13:00] [pin] text`

- `w` = weight (default 10) — decay/consolidation base
- `h` = reference count — consolidation input
- `t` = write time — decay age source
- `pin` = locked (excluded from decay, always injected)

## Memory Metabolism (Dream)

`/memory dream` (or `memory action=dream`) manually triggers memory metabolism — the housekeeping a sleeping brain does:

1. **Half-life decay** (default 7 days): weight halves every half-life (`w × 0.5^(age/halfLife)`), floored at 1.
2. **Reference consolidation**: entries referenced ≥ `consolidateThreshold` (default 3) times gain +1 weight, capped at `weightCap` (default 20).
3. **Conflict surfacing (v0.5.2)**: when behavior memory conflicts with preferences it is no longer silently halved — it is exempted from decay/archival, stays active, and floats to the top of listings and the session snapshot so **you** can judge and edit it. A `CONFLICT` audit event is recorded; once you edit it into agreement, normal metabolism resumes.
4. **Archiving**: entries whose weight drops below `decayThreshold` (default 3) move to `archive/` — moved, never deleted.

Usage:

```
/memory dream            # run metabolism
/memory dream --dry-run  # preview only, no changes
memory action=dream dryRun=true   # same via the memory tool
```

Dry-run example output:

```
【预览】扫描 120 条：衰减 12 · 巩固 3 · 冲突 0 · 归档 4
备份：（dry-run 不执行备份）
```

**Backup & rollback**: before an actual run, the whole memory store is automatically copied to `backups/<timestamp>/` (including `audit.jsonl`). On startup, the self-check restores the latest backup automatically if a primary memory file is found corrupted. Rollbacks are recorded as `ROLLBACK` audit events.

## Auto recall / auto save (v0.4.0)

Three automatic layers on top of explicit calls:

1. **Approval fallback**: important memories normally require approval; when approval is unavailable (policy `never` / service missing), they are saved automatically per `approvalFallback` (default `auto`), audited as `[降级]`. Switch to `deny` in settings to stay fail-closed.
2. **Auto consolidation (use-it-or-lose-it)**: every keyword query/recall hit bumps `hits+1` and writes back — memories that get recalled often decay slower (audit `RECALL`).
3. **Auto dream/reflect**: `autoDreamDays` (default 7) and `autoReflectDays` (default 3) run metabolism/reflection at startup when older than the interval; `0` disables. Audit `AUTO-DREAM` / `AUTO-REFLECT`.

## Deep reflection (Reflect, v0.4.0)

`/memory reflect` (or `memory action=reflect`, settings tab) — a purely local, LLM-free periodic summary:

1. **Topic clustering**: all entries clustered by TF cosine similarity (≥0.25) to surface recurring topics;
2. **Trend stats**: writes in the last 7 days vs the previous week (rising / steady);
3. **Conflict alerts**: behavior memories that clash with preferences;
4. **Forget candidates**: low-weight entries worth reviewing.

Reports are written to `longterm/reflections/<timestamp>.md`; `--dry-run` previews without writing.

## Knowledge page (v0.4.0)

The settings page gains a **Knowledge** tab: full-text/semantic search, layer filter, per-entry weight/hits/time/pin display, one-click pin/unpin, **edit** (inline textarea) and **safe removal** (backed up first, restorable). Conflicting behavior entries float to the top with a red badge. Web API: `GET /biomemory/api/entries`, `POST /biomemory/api/entries/pin|unpin|update|remove`, `POST /biomemory/api/reflect`.

## Memory Pins

Lock a memory so it never participates in decay and always enters the snapshot:

```
/memory pin <fp>      # lock
/memory unpin <fp>    # unlock
memory action=pin fp="xxx"
memory action=unpin fp="xxx"
```

Snapshot injection priority: **pinned > preferences > knowledge > behavior**.

## Audit

Two audit channels:

- `audit.log` — human-readable one-line summaries, backward compatible
- `audit.jsonl` — structured, one JSON object per line

Events: `WRITE`, `DECAY`, `CONSOLIDATE`, `CONFLICT`, `ARCHIVE`, `PIN`, `UNPIN`, `PREVIEW` (dry-run), `ROLLBACK`.

Example line:

```json
{"t":"2026-08-16T05:00:00.000Z","event":"DECAY","fp":"abc123","text":"..."}
```

Query:

```
/memory audit                    # recent events
/memory audit --since 7d         # last 7 days
/memory audit --type DECAY       # only DECAY events
memory action=audit type="DECAY" sinceDays=7
```

## Semantic Retrieval

Keyword matching runs first; when hits are insufficient, results are supplemented with a pure-JS TF-IDF + cosine implementation — **no native modules, no external dependencies**, fully offline. Semantic hits are marked as "semantic" in query output.

## Configuration

```js
// Plugin config (bundle or profile layer)
{
  halfLifeDays: 7,          // half-life in days for decay
  decayThreshold: 3,        // weight below this → archived
  consolidateThreshold: 3,  // references ≥ this → consolidate (+1 weight)
  weightCap: 20,            // consolidation weight cap (prevents runaway growth)
  hotTokenLimit: 5000,      // snapshot hot-section token budget
  maxQueryResults: 20,      // query result cap
  petEndpoint: null         // optional: local notification service URL (off by default)
}
```

## Compatibility

- Node >= 22.19.0
- `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` >= 0.1.1-rc.2 runtime (implemented against actual lib sources)

## Troubleshooting (FAQ)

- **Node version**: requires Node >= 22.19.0; older versions may fail to load the plugin.
- **DSH runtime compatibility**: targets `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` >= 0.1.1-rc.2 (current latest line; tested on 0.1.2-rc.1 too) — check the version of the runtime you actually run.
- **Memory directory issues**: if writes fail, check read/write permissions on the memory root; if `DSH_MEMORY_ROOT` is set, it must point to an existing, writable directory.
- **Native module conflicts**: this plugin has **no native dependencies** — it is pure JS, so it cannot clash with native modules of other plugins.

## Usage Scenarios

- **Personal knowledge base, long-term maintenance**: accumulate facts and decisions over time, query them later like a second brain; decay and archiving keep the store tidy without manual pruning.
- **Project experience accumulation**: lessons, habits and decisions live per-project in `projects/<name>/`, consolidating (weight grows) as topics are referenced repeatedly.
- **Cross-session preference memory**: preferences are injected at every session start, pin important ones for stability, and let conflict arbitration keep preferences authoritative over behavior.

## Contributing

- **Report issues**: open an issue with the DSH runtime version, Node version, and reproduction steps.
- **Pull requests**: fork the repository, make the change, add/update tests, and run `npm test` before submitting.
- **Tests**: run `npm test` (node:test). New behavior should ship with test coverage.
