# dsh-chatgpt-bridge

[![M8ven Score](https://m8ven.ai/badge/mcp/jiezeng2004-design-dsh-chatgpt-bridge-14d0zo)](https://m8ven.ai/mcp/jiezeng2004-design-dsh-chatgpt-bridge-14d0zo)

An MCP bridge that lets **ChatGPT Web** create, view, continue and supervise
**DeepSeek Harness (DSH)** agent sessions through the official **Model Context
Protocol**. v0.4.1 — *DSH 0.1.1-rc.1 Compatibility Release & Native Settings*.
The v0.3.0 Goal Control Plane and v0.4.0 Native Settings are preserved. The bridge only
*connects* — DSH keeps its own session log, agent loop, tools, skills,
subagents, workflows, approvals, sandbox and workspace security model. It is a
standalone DSH plugin: **zero DSH core modifications**.

> **Direction of control: ChatGPT Web → secure MCP tunnel → this bridge → DSH.**
> This project lets the **ChatGPT web app call and supervise your local or
> self-hosted DSH**. It does not make DSH call ChatGPT, and it does not route
> DSH model requests through ChatGPT.

> Self-hosted / dogfooding development: implemented against DeepSeek
> Harness and verified end-to-end against live local DSH
> runtimes (verified up to `0.1.1-rc.1`) with the official MCP SDK client.

## Project status / maintenance

This project is actively maintained as an independent DSH plugin. The primary
maintainer is [`jiezeng2004-design`](https://github.com/jiezeng2004-design).
Ongoing maintenance includes tracking DeepSeek Harness upstream compatibility,
preparing compatibility releases, preserving MCP tool/schema behavior, testing
runtime lifecycle and security-sensitive tunnel changes, and keeping install
and operational documentation current.

The latest public release is `dsh-chatgpt-bridge@0.4.1`, verified against DSH
`0.1.1-rc.1`. Releases, compatibility updates and regression testing are part
of the project's continuing maintenance responsibilities.

# Quick Start

This gets a new user from zero to a verified ChatGPT ↔ DSH connection. Deep
architecture and configuration details follow below — you do not need them to
install and verify.

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 22** installed and on your `PATH`.
- **A working DeepSeek Harness (DSH) installation** — `dsh` on your `PATH`
  (or use `pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1` in place of `dsh` in every
  command below).
- **A web profile is recommended.** The Web UI and the Bridge should run in
  the same web profile/runtime so that ChatGPT-created sessions appear live
  in DSH Web.
- **ChatGPT-side MCP and write-action availability depends on your current
  plan/workspace. Check OpenAI's current official documentation before
  setup.**
- **This plugin includes write/action tools** (`dsh_send_message`,
  `dsh_start_goal`, `dsh_approve`, ...), not just read-only MCP. It drives a
  real DSH agent that can modify files inside **registered workspaces** under
  DSH's approval/sandbox policy. Treat it accordingly.

## 1. Install

Recommended — install the plugin into the web profile (from the published npm
package):

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-chatgpt-bridge
```

`npm install dsh-chatgpt-bridge` alone is not enough: the plugin must be
added to a DSH profile bundle, which `dsh plugin ... add` does for you. See
[Detailed install](#detailed-install) for source, headless, and manual
variants.

## 2. Start one shared DSH runtime

```bash
dsh web
```

Run the DSH Web UI and the Bridge in the **same** web profile/runtime.
ChatGPT-created sessions are native DSH sessions; they only stream live in
DSH Web when both share one runtime.

| Endpoint | URL |
| --- | --- |
| DSH Web | http://127.0.0.1:3080 |
| Bridge MCP | http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp |

## 3. Read the authentication token

On first boot the bridge generates a token and persists it to
`$DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge.token`. Read it with:

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-Content "$HOME\.dsh\chatgpt-bridge.token"
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
cat ~/.dsh/chatgpt-bridge.token
```

> **Never commit this token to GitHub or paste it into a public chat.** It
> authorizes MCP access to your DSH runtime. Alternatively, set
> `DSH_CHATGPT_BRIDGE_TOKEN` yourself and the bridge uses it instead of the
> generated file.

## 4. Connect ChatGPT

**ChatGPT Web cannot open a plain localhost MCP endpoint.** A URL like
`http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp` exists only on your machine; ChatGPT Web is a
remote MCP client and cannot reach it directly.

- If the Bridge runs on your machine, connect ChatGPT through the **Secure
  MCP Tunnel / secure tunneling mechanism that OpenAI currently supports**
  for MCP/custom apps. The tunnel forwards ChatGPT's requests to the loopback
  endpoint.
- Use the token from step 3 as the MCP **Authorization Bearer** token for the
  connector/tunnel.
- The Bridge keeps its localhost-first design: it binds `127.0.0.1`, never
  exposes a public interface, and never self-hosts a tunnel.
- The **stdio transport is not the ChatGPT Web quick path** — ChatGPT Web does
  not launch local processes. See
  [Advanced / other MCP clients](#advanced--other-mcp-clients) for stdio and
  non-ChatGPT MCP clients.

## 5. Scan / refresh tools

After the MCP connection is established, **scan / refresh the MCP tools** in
ChatGPT. The bridge exposes **15 tools**, and `dsh_update_goal` must be present
(it is the 15th). If the tool list looks stale, refresh/rescan the connector
(see [Tool count is stale](#tool-count-is-stale--dsh_update_goal-missing-after-upgrade)).

## 6. First verification

Give ChatGPT this read-only acceptance prompt:

```text
请使用已连接的 DSH App，只做只读检查：
1. 调用 dsh_health
2. 调用 dsh_list_workspaces
3. 不修改任何文件
4. 返回 bridge version、health 和 workspace 名称
```

Expected:

```text
health = ok
bridge version = 0.4.1
```

Then a minimal Goal Supervision example (still read-only):

```text
使用 dsh_start_goal 创建一个只读检查目标（workspace 用 dsh_list_workspaces
查到的名称），goal 描述为“只读检查项目”，plan 为列出项目结构并总结
README，constraints 使用 {"read_only": true}。然后反复调用 dsh_wait_goal
直到 terminal，最后只汇报 health、goal revision 和总结，不修改任何文件。
```

## Native Settings & Tunnel Runtime (v0.4.0)

The DSH Web **Settings → ChatGPT Bridge** page manages the whole Tunnel story
in the GUI: configure the OpenAI tunnel, save the Runtime API key, start /
stop / restart a plugin-owned `tunnel-client`, read live status, run layered
diagnostics and inspect redacted logs. No hand-written PowerShell required.

- **Runtime config** lives in `$DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge/runtime-config.json`
  (separate from the Bridge ConfigSchema). Secrets live in
  `$DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge/secrets/` and are referenced by the generated
  profile only as `file:` references.
- **Management API**: loopback-only `/_dsh/chatgpt-bridge/*` on the DSH web
  server, with Host/Origin/Content-Type/custom-header CSRF checks. No CORS
  wildcard.
- **Runtime ownership**: `tunnel-client run` is spawned with `shell:false`,
  tracked by ProcessIdentity. Every destructive termination — including the
  graceful SIGTERM and the subsequent Windows `taskkill /T /F` or POSIX
  `SIGKILL` — runs only after a fresh identity verification
  (**PID + normalized executable path + process start time**). A mismatch,
  unreadable probe, thrown probe, or missing process fails closed: the
  plugin never hard-kills a PID that may have been reused. Startup health /
  ready timeout cleanup uses the same path; there is no “just spawned”
  bypass. The per-launch `runtimeInstanceId` is manager metadata, not an
  OS-verified marker. DSH unload stops the plugin-owned runtime. The Bridge
  bearer auth is preserved end-to-end through `mcp.extra_headers` with a
  `file:` secret ref. Persistent runtime recovery (PID adoption after
  crash), Native Runtime, and runtime hot-switching are **not** in v0.4.0.
- **Lifecycle latch**: lifecycle/ownership failures
  (`stale-process-identity`, `start-time-mismatch`, `unknown-start-time`,
  `tunnel-stop-timeout`) remain latched until shutdown ownership is explicitly
  resolved (confirmed stop, confirmed cleanup, successful fresh start);
  health/readiness polling alone cannot restore `overall` to `ready`.
- **Status probe provenance**: runtime status probe failures (including
  `RuntimeManager.diagnostics()` and `refresh()`) are treated as unknown
  state, not confirmed process exit; ownership is retained (`owned=true`)
  and surfaced as `status-failed` until the runtime is successfully
  observed as stopped/exited or explicitly stopped. A failed probe never
  starts a second tunnel.
- **Diagnostics**: the page's *Run diagnostics* invokes the real
  `tunnel-client doctor --profile-file ... --json` through the runtime's
  `doctor()` alongside the layered bridge / process / key / proxy checks.
  Steps are normalized and redacted; a doctor failure or a thrown status
  probe is a structured failed step and never crashes the management API.
- **Backend**: v0.4.0 defaults to `ProcessTunnelRuntime` (plugin-owned
  process supervision, DSH-native Settings, Auto Start, ownership-safe
  lifecycle, status/health/diagnostics). The `TunnelRuntime` interface is
  the future Native Runtime abstraction seam; v0.4.0 does not implement
  `NativeManagedTunnelRuntime` or process↔native hot switching. Settings
  changes take effect on the next user Restart.
- **tunnel-client**: detected from the configured executable path, then
  `PATH`, then a short list of well-known install directories (including
  `D:\Application\tunnel-client\` on Windows), then the image path of an
  already-running `tunnel-client` (as a hint only — the plugin never takes
  over that process). Official tunnel-client profiles
  (`%APPDATA%\tunnel-client\*.yaml` / `~/.config/tunnel-client/*.yaml`)
  supply Tunnel ID and control-plane URL when our own config is empty.
  Secret values are never imported or returned. If nothing is found, the
  page shows *Not installed*. No automatic download/install is performed.

### Client bundle build

```bash
npm run build          # server (tsc) + client (scripts/build-client.mjs)
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

The client bundle (`lib/client.js`) is produced in the DSH module-loader
format (`window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })`) and declared via the
`dsh.client` manifest in `package.json`. The factory acquires React with
`require('react')` from the DSH ModuleLoader; it does not depend on a
browser-global React object.

---

## Troubleshooting

### ChatGPT cannot connect

`http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp` is a loopback address on your machine — ChatGPT
Web cannot reach it as a remote MCP server. Check the **Secure MCP Tunnel /
currently supported secure connection** method for MCP/custom apps: the
tunnel must forward to the loopback endpoint with the bearer token.

### 401 Unauthorized

- Read the token: `Get-Content "$HOME\.dsh\chatgpt-bridge.token"`
  (PowerShell) or `cat ~/.dsh/chatgpt-bridge.token` (macOS/Linux).
- The connector must send it as the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header.
- The token belongs to the runtime that generated it. A different
  `$DSH_HOME`, a regenerated token, or a mismatched `DSH_CHATGPT_BRIDGE_TOKEN`
  all cause 401 — make sure the token matches the currently running runtime.

### dsh_health works but no workspace appears

`dsh_list_workspaces` only lists workspaces **already registered** in DSH.
The bridge never auto-registers arbitrary paths; `dsh_create_session` with an
unregistered path fails with `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND` on purpose. Register the
workspace in DSH (Web profile workspace settings / DSH configuration) first.

### Session exists but does not appear live in DSH Web

The Bridge and DSH Web must run in the **same web profile/runtime**. Do not
run a separate `chatgpt-bridge` runtime **and** a separate `web` runtime and
expect live parity — sessions persist and can be resumed, but they will not
stream in real time.

### Tool count is stale / dsh_update_goal missing after upgrade

Re-scan / refresh the MCP tools on the ChatGPT side after upgrading the
plugin and restarting the profile. The bridge exposes **15 tools**;
`dsh_update_goal` is the 15th.

### Port 3456 already in use

Identify the process first — **never auto-kill an unknown process**. On
Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3456 | Select-Object LocalAddress, LocalPort, OwningProcess
Get-Process -Id <OwningProcess> | Select-Object Id, ProcessName, Path
```

On macOS/Linux:

```bash
lsof -iTCP:3456 -sTCP:LISTEN     # or: ss -ltnp 'sport = :3456'
```

If it is an old `dsh`/bridge process, stop it cleanly. Otherwise change the
bridge `port` in the profile config (see
[DSH configuration](#dsh-configuration)) or free the port.

### Bridge error codes

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
| --- | --- |
| `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND` | The workspace is not registered in DSH; `dsh_list_workspaces` shows what is allowed. |
| `SESSION_NOT_FOUND` | Unknown session id (never created, or persistence not mounted). |
| `SESSION_NOT_LIVE` on cancel | The session is not loaded in this process; only live sessions can be cancelled. |
| `APPROVAL_NOT_FOUND` / `QUESTION_NOT_FOUND` | The decision was already taken or the bridge restarted (parked decisions are in-memory). |
| question provider slot taken (log) | A web UI is attached and owns user questions; answer them in the UI. |
| Cold sessions show no title in `dsh_list_sessions` | Cold titles come from the projection cache; concurrent DSH profiles sharing the cache can clobber rows. Single-profile deployments get titles. |

---

## 60-second smoke test

After completing Quick Start steps 1–3:

1. `dsh web` — one shared runtime.
2. Establish the MCP tunnel to `http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp`.
3. In ChatGPT: **Scan Tools**.
4. Ask ChatGPT to call `dsh_health`.
5. Confirm:
   - `health = ok`
   - `bridge version = 0.4.1`
   - **tool count = 15**
   - `dsh_update_goal` exists in the tool list
6. Optionally call `dsh_list_workspaces` to confirm your workspace is
   visible.

## Architecture

```text
ChatGPT Web
      |
      | MCP (Streamable HTTP / stdio)
      v
dsh-chatgpt-bridge        <- a DSH (Cordis) plugin row
      |
      v
DeepSeek Harness          <- sessions, agents, tools, approvals, sandbox, workspace
      |
 +----+--------------+
 |    |              |
Session   Agent     Workflow
 |    |              |
 +----+------+-------+
             v
       Local Workspace
```

The bridge uses DSH's public plugin seams — it never re-implements DSH:

| DSH capability seam | Usage in the bridge |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.agents` (AgentRegistry) | `create()` / `resume()` / `get()` — live agent lookup, session creation, and **resume of persisted sessions after restarts** |
| `ctx.sessions` (SessionStore) | live session listing, `flush()` durability |
| `ctx.sessionPersistence` | `list()` / `inspect()` — the DSH session log is the **authority** for session identity across ChatGPT conversations |
| `ctx.sessionTitle` | title read/write (plus the `session/title` log fold) |
| `ctx.workspaceRegistry` | list + resolve — **only registered workspaces** can host sessions |
| `ctx.approval` (`approval/request` waterfall) | the bridge is an **answerer**: approvals park as `waiting_for_approval` and are decided one-by-one |
| `ctx.userQuestions` (`registerProvider`) | the bridge is the question **provider**: questions park as `waiting_for_user` |
| `ctx.agentDefaultModel` | default provider/model selection for created sessions |
| `ctx.agentPresets` (`mount`) | same per-session preset composition the Web UI uses, when a roster exists |
| `installModelSelection` (dsh-agent) | per-agent model selection with log-derived fallback on resume |
| `createUserMessage` + `agent.followup()` | the canonical way to continue a session's durable log |

### MCP facts

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Transport | **Streamable HTTP** (default, `http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp`) or **stdio** |
| Protocol version | negotiated by `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30.0 (official MCP SDK) |
| Authentication | Bearer token (default): config token → `DSH_CHATGPT_BRIDGE_TOKEN` env → generated token persisted to `$DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge.token` |
| Local endpoint | `http://127.0.0.1:3456/mcp` (loopback only by default) |
| ChatGPT connection | any official MCP client: a local connector at the endpoint with the token, or a remote connector tunneled to the loopback endpoint (e.g. OpenAI's supported Secure MCP Tunnel). The bridge never exposes anything public by itself. |

---

## Detailed install

The plugin is a standard DSH profile bundle. It currently targets DSH
`0.1.1-rc.1` (verified baseline).

**Recommended: one DSH runtime for both Web `:3080` and the MCP bridge `:3456`.**
ChatGPT-created sessions are native DSH sessions. The Web UI only sees them
live if it shares `ctx.agents` / `ctx.sessions` with the bridge. Do not run a
headless `chatgpt-bridge` profile *and* a separate `web` profile at the same
time — that is two runtimes and live Web parity will fail.

### Install into the Web profile (recommended)

The Quick Start uses `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-chatgpt-bridge`. If
`dsh` is not on your `PATH`, the equivalent is:

```bash
pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1 plugin --profile web add dsh-chatgpt-bridge
# published: ... add dsh-chatgpt-bridge@0.4.1

# boot ONE process — Web :3080 and MCP :3456
pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1 --profile web
```

`dsh_health.capabilities.webSurface` is `true` when the Web gateway is in this
process.

### Headless-only (optional)

A dedicated `chatgpt-bridge` profile (no Web) still works. Sessions persist
and can be resumed later, but DSH Web `:3080` will not stream them in real
time.

```bash
pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1 plugin --profile chatgpt-bridge add dsh-chatgpt-bridge@0.4.1
pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1 --profile chatgpt-bridge
```

The published npm package is available at
[`dsh-chatgpt-bridge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-chatgpt-bridge).

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiezeng2004-design/dsh-chatgpt-bridge.git
cd dsh-chatgpt-bridge
npm ci
npm run build
pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1 plugin --profile web add "file:$PWD"
pnpm dlx @deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.1 --profile web
```

For either installation method, `dsh plugin` installs the package into the
profile and, because the package declares `dsh.bundle.patch`, appends it to the
profile's bundle list. The bundle patch inserts only the `chatgpt-bridge` row
so it can sit on top of `dsh-web-app` without duplicating `storage` /
`workspace` ids.

A headless profile (no web-app) still needs those host rows. Copy
[`cordis.headless.patch.yml`](./cordis.headless.patch.yml) into that profile's
own `cordis.patch.yml`.

If pnpm cannot run in your environment (e.g. symlinks blocked), install
manually: create `$DSH_HOME/profiles/chatgpt-bridge/` with `package.json`
(`dsh.profile.bundles: ["@deepseek-ai/dsh-base", "dsh-chatgpt-bridge"]`),
empty `cordis.yml` / `cordis.patch.yml`, and a
`node_modules/dsh-chatgpt-bridge` link to this checkout. The checkout's own
`node_modules` may be a junction to the DSH installation's hoisted
`node_modules` so both sides share one module instance.

### DSH configuration

Only the plugin's own row config (defaults shown):

```yaml
- id: chatgpt-bridge
  name: dsh-chatgpt-bridge
  config:
    transport: http        # http | stdio
    host: 127.0.0.1        # loopback only by default
    port: 3456
    authMode: token        # token | none (loopback only, not recommended)
    authToken: ''          # static token; empty falls back to env, then generated file
    authTokenEnv: DSH_CHATGPT_BRIDGE_TOKEN
    tokenFile: ''          # default $DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge.token
    resultMaxChars: 8000
    resultMaxItems: 50
    sessionMaxItems: 20
    sessionMaxChars: 4000
    logLevel: info
```

Logs go to `$DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge.log` (redacted) and never to stdout, so
the stdio transport stays clean.

---

## Advanced / other MCP clients

The Bridge supports two MCP transports:

| Transport | When to use |
| --- | --- |
| **Streamable HTTP** (default) | ChatGPT Web via a secure tunnel, and any HTTP-capable MCP client that can reach the loopback endpoint. |
| **stdio** | Local MCP clients that launch a child process on the same machine as the bridge. |

The stdio transport is **not** the ChatGPT Web quick path: ChatGPT Web does
not launch local processes, so it cannot use a stdio connector. Use stdio
only with clients that run on the same machine as the bridge.

To use stdio, set `transport: stdio` in the profile config (see
[DSH configuration](#dsh-configuration)) and point the client at the command
that boots the bridge profile (`dsh --profile chatgpt-bridge`). The boot
process must not print to stdout; bridge logs go to
`$DSH_HOME/chatgpt-bridge.log` only.

No ChatGPT cookies, logins, or web sessions are ever touched: ChatGPT is
strictly an MCP client of the bridge.

---

## MCP tool catalog

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dsh_health` | Bridge/DSH status, versions, session counts, capabilities. Never contains tokens/keys/cookies. |
| `dsh_list_workspaces` | Workspaces DSH already registered (id, title, path, counts). |
| `dsh_create_session` | Create a real DSH session bound to a registered workspace (id/path/title). Optional `title` and `initial_message`. |
| `dsh_list_sessions` | Live + persisted sessions, newest first, paged (`limit`/`offset`), optional workspace filter. |
| `dsh_get_session` | Status, workspace, bounded recent-message summary (`max_items`/`max_chars`), pending work, waiting approvals/questions, todos. |
| `dsh_send_message` | **Continue an existing DSH session** (live agent, or resume from persistence). Returns immediately; long tasks run in the background. |
| `dsh_get_task_status` | `idle`, `queued`, `running`, `waiting_for_user`, `waiting_for_approval`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `blocked`, `max-tokens`, `interrupted` (DSH-native turn-end reasons). |
| `dsh_get_result` | Last turn's assistant text, status, tool calls, changed files (from the session log), structured error. |
| `dsh_cancel_task` | Cancel through DSH's own `agent.cancel()` — no PID killing. |
| `dsh_answer_question` | Answer a parked user question (`waiting_for_user`). |
| `dsh_approve` | Decide one parked approval (`waiting_for_approval`) — requires the exact `approval_id` and an explicit `approve`/`reject`. No approve-all. |
| `dsh_start_goal` | Hand DSH a multi-step goal/plan (new or existing session). Existing `session_id` revises the Goal (revision +1). Optional `execution_mode` / `constraints`. |
| `dsh_update_goal` | Revise / defer / resume an existing Goal. `session_id` required; never creates a session. |
| `dsh_wait_goal` | Bounded long-poll (default 25s). If `continuation_required` is true, call again immediately. |
| `dsh_stop_goal` | Idempotent stop/cancel/interrupt of the supervised goal. Fails closed pending approvals/questions. |

### Goal Supervision (recommended for plans)

```text
ChatGPT plans the work
      |
      v
dsh_start_goal(workspace, goal, plan?)
      |
      |  continuation_required=true
      v
dsh_wait_goal(session_id)   ---- still running ----+
      |                                            |
      |  continuation_required=true                |
      +--------------------------------------------+
      |
      +-- waiting_for_approval --> ask user --> dsh_approve --> wait again
      +-- waiting_for_user     --> ask user --> dsh_answer_question --> wait again
      +-- completed / failed / cancelled --> done (result is in the wait payload)
```

- `continuation_required` is an MCP client contract: ChatGPT should call
  `dsh_wait_goal` again **in the same assistant turn** until the loop stops.
  Do not reply "the task is running in the background" and end the turn.
- One MCP call waits internally (≈500ms polls, up to 25s). Do not spam
  `dsh_get_task_status` every few hundred milliseconds.
- `waiting_for_approval` / `waiting_for_user` set `needs_user_action` and
  **do not** continue. Never auto-approve; never guess the answer.
- `dsh_stop_goal` is the user-facing "stop DSH" tool. It is idempotent
  (`already_stopped=true` if the session is already terminal).
- Optional `request_id` on `dsh_start_goal` makes connector retries in the
  **same process** idempotent. It is an in-memory map (cap 256), not a Goal
  DB. After a process restart, continue with `session_id`.
- `dsh_health.capabilities.goalSupervision` is always true in v0.2+.
- The stabilization work originally tracked as "0.2.1" (never released) is
  folded into v0.3.0: reconciled todos (from tool/result facts, not assistant
  text), `progress_delta` on `dsh_wait_goal`, structured `blocked` +
  `remaining_runnable_steps`, and fail-safe cleanup of goal-owned temps.
- v0.3.0 adds `dsh_update_goal` (15 tools) and a Goal Control Plane: revisions,
  execution modes, structured constraints, deferred/resume, bounded history.

Low-level tools remain for inspection and one-shot messages.

### Goal lifecycle

```text
create   dsh_start_goal(workspace, goal, plan?, execution_mode?, constraints?)
           -> revision 1, session_id
run      DSH agent works; ChatGPT calls dsh_wait_goal
wait     continuation_required → wait again
         waiting_for_user / waiting_for_approval → ask human, then continue
revise   dsh_update_goal(action=revise)  or  dsh_start_goal(..., session_id)
           -> revision +1, previous snapshot kept
defer    dsh_update_goal(action=defer, defer_steps=["npm_publish"])
           -> step is deferred (not failed); independent branches stay runnable
resume   dsh_update_goal(action=resume, resume_steps=["npm_publish"])
           -> same session_id + goal_id; completed steps are not replayed
complete wait returns terminal + result; deferred_steps may still be listed
stop     dsh_stop_goal  (no revision bump; goal_cancelled event)
```

Approval and question answers do **not** increment revision.

### Execution modes

| Mode | When | Behaviour |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `standard` | default, omitted | Current v0.2 agent instructions. Reasonable analysis/tests allowed. |
| `minimal` | "only wait 35s", smoke, no extra work | Only actions strictly required. Default constraints: no workspace scan, `max_changed_files=0`. |
| `strict` | user-supplied plan/constraints | Follow the plan/constraints; do not expand scope. |

### Constraints (examples)

```json
{
  "read_only": true,
  "allow_workspace_scan": false,
  "max_changed_files": 0,
  "forbidden_actions": ["filesystem.scan", "filesystem.write"]
}
```

Constraints can only **tighten** DSH sandbox/approval. `read_only=false` does not grant write. Runtime enforcement uses the approval waterfall (`toolName` + optional `callId` lookup of the logged `tool/call`) plus post-hoc fact checks. A bash command that never asks approval can only be caught after the fact.

Action classes: `filesystem.read`, `filesystem.write`, `filesystem.scan`, `process.exec`, `git.mutate`, `npm.publish`, `github.release`, `network`.

### Dependency-aware Goal (npm + GitHub Release)

```text
commit → verify → push → tag
                         ├─ npm publish      (may defer on 2FA)
                         └─ GitHub Release   (still runnable)
```

When npm hits 2FA: `dsh_update_goal({ action: "defer", defer_steps: ["npm_publish"] })`. GitHub Release continues on the same session. Later `action: "resume"` reactivates npm without retagging or repushing.

### Deliberately NOT exposed (first version)

`execute_shell`, `run_command`, `read_any_file`, `write_any_file`,
`delete_file`, `git_push`, `install_package`, `run_arbitrary_tool`.
ChatGPT never gets a direct shell: it talks to the DSH agent, and the DSH
agent uses DSH tools under DSH's approval/sandbox/workspace policy.

## Session lifecycle

Preferred (v0.2 Goal Supervision):

```text
ChatGPT: dsh_start_goal(workspace, goal, plan)
         -> { session_id, continuation_required, next_tool_call: dsh_wait_goal }
ChatGPT: dsh_wait_goal(session_id)  (repeat while continuation_required)
         -> { terminal: true, result: { summary, changed_files, todos } }
```

Low-level Session API (still supported):

```text
ChatGPT: dsh_create_session(workspace)
         -> session_id (e.g. session-034daf61-...)
ChatGPT: dsh_send_message(session_id, "帮我分析这个项目，不修改文件。")
         -> {accepted: true}            # returns immediately
DSH:     agent.followup() -> turn runs in the background
ChatGPT: dsh_get_task_status(session_id) -> running -> completed
ChatGPT: dsh_get_result(session_id)      -> analysis text
ChatGPT: dsh_send_message(session_id, "刚才第 2 项不错，现在实现它。")
         -> same session, same agent loop, same durable log
```

**DSH is the authority for session identity.** Sessions persist as
`$DSH_HOME/sessions/<workspace>/<session-id>/session.jsonl.zstd` (event log)
and survive bridge restarts, ChatGPT conversations, and DSH restarts:
`dsh_send_message` on a cold session resumes it through `ctx.agents.resume()`,
which replays the log into the model context (verified: a marker learned
before a process restart was still remembered afterwards).

---

## Security model

- **No arbitrary shell tool** — see the tool catalog.
- **Workspace boundary** — sessions can only be created in workspaces DSH
  already registered (`ctx.workspaceRegistry`). Arbitrary paths are never
  opened or auto-registered; `dsh_create_session` with `C:\Users\...`, `/`,
  `~`, etc. is rejected with `WORKSPACE_NOT_FOUND`.
- **Approval is never bypassed** — if DSH asks for approval, the bridge parks
  the request (`waiting_for_approval`) and only `dsh_approve` with the exact
  approval id can grant it, **once, for that exact tool call**
  (`allowed-once`). No auto-approve, no approve-all. If the bridge unloads
  while requests are parked, they resolve `cancelled` (fail closed).
- **Sandbox is inherited, not weakened** — created sessions get
  `meta.cwd = workspace.path`, so DSH's per-session sandbox confines the
  agent's file effects to that workspace.
- **Localhost-first** — the HTTP server binds `127.0.0.1` by default.
- **Secret redaction** — all bridge logs and tool outputs pass through a
  redactor (sk-... keys, bearer tokens, key=value secrets, OTP, secret-shaped
  keys). Goal history never stores OTP, tokens, cookies, or Authorization
  headers. The generated token is never logged.
- **Goal constraints tighten only** — they never raise sandbox or approval
  rights. OTP supplied for one exact operation is not persisted.
- **No ChatGPT credentials** — the bridge never reads cookies, never drives a
  browser, never stores OpenAI session tokens.

---

## Approval behavior (concrete)

1. The DSH agent requests a permission. DSH emits `approval/request`.
2. The bridge (an answerer for its own sessions) parks the request; the
   session shows `waiting_for_approval` with
   `{approval_id, tool_name, call_id?, reason?}`.
3. ChatGPT calls `dsh_approve(session_id, approval_id, "approve")` →
   `allowed-once`; or `"reject"` → `rejected` and the call fails closed.
4. The agent's turn continues.

Sessions created by the web UI keep being answered by the web UI answerer;
the bridge only answers approvals for sessions it created. In a profile
where the web UI already owns the single user-questions provider slot,
questions flow through that provider instead (reported in `dsh_health`
capabilities).

## User question behavior

When the agent calls the ask-user tool, the bridge (as the registered
provider) parks the question; the session shows `waiting_for_user` with the
question text/options, and `dsh_answer_question` resolves it. Answers are
validated against the offered options.

## Long task behavior

`dsh_send_message` returns immediately with `{accepted: true}`. The agent
loop runs in the background; `dsh_get_task_status` polls
`queued -> running -> completed|failed|cancelled`. Cancellation goes through
DSH's own `agent.cancel({kind:'user'})`, which aborts the active turn
(turn-end reason `aborted`) or discards still-queued messages — DSH's
semantics, not a second task system.

## Tests

```bash
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm test              # node scripts/test.mjs — unit suite in one process;
                      #   selects the test-isolation flag for the current
                      #   Node (Node 22: experimental name; Node 23+: stable)
npm run dogfood       # full MCP client flow against a running bridge
npm run dogfood:goal  # v0.3.0 Goal Control Plane: minimal 35s + defer/resume DAG
npm run resume-test   # create marker session -> restart the DSH profile ->
                      #   continue the same session -> marker survives
npm run demo-flow     # two-step demo (analyze, then implement + test)
```

The dogfood/resume/demo scripts use the official `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`
**client** over Streamable HTTP against the booted profile — the same
protocol ChatGPT speaks.

---

## Uninstall / disable

- **Disable:** in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` add
  `- id: chatgpt-bridge` + `  disabled: true`, then restart the profile. The
  MCP endpoint disappears; DSH keeps running untouched (verified).
- **Uninstall:** `dsh plugin --profile chatgpt-bridge remove dsh-chatgpt-bridge`
  (or delete the profile directory). Bridge-created agents are disposed with
  the plugin; their **session logs remain persisted** and can be resumed
  later from any profile sharing `$DSH_HOME`.
- Sessions created by the bridge continue to exist and can be continued by
  the Web UI or any other entry point — DSH's session log is shared.

DSH core modifications: **0**.

---

## Current limitations

- First version is **ChatGPT -> DSH** only: it drives DSH sessions; it does
  not expose a full remote control plane (no file browsing, no arbitrary
  tool passthrough).
- Parked approvals/questions live in the bridge process; a bridge restart
  while something is parked resolves them `cancelled` (fail closed).
- `dsh_get_result.changed_files` is derived from the session log's tool
  calls (arguments of known editing tools) — data-driven, not a diff viewer.
- The `waiting_for_user` provider slot is single-slot; in a profile where
  the Web UI already owns it, questions flow through the UI.
- Stdio mode is supported, but the boot process must not print to stdout;
  prefer the HTTP transport unless a client requires stdio.
- Live ChatGPT validation was completed on 2026-08-14 through a tunneled MCP
  connection: ChatGPT discovered and invoked `dsh_health` and
  `dsh_list_workspaces`. The automated dogfood/resume flows additionally use
  the official MCP SDK client against the same Streamable HTTP endpoint.
