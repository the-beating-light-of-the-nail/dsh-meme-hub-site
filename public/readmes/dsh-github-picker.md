GitHub issue and pull request references for the DeepSeek Harness web GUI. Click the GitHub icon next to the send button to search the current workspace repository's issues and PRs, and insert a reference — a GitHub URL or an `@owner/repo#number` mention.

![dsh-github-picker in the DeepSeek Harness web GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitxeno/dsh-github-picker/fe41806cf944a0be92a6e4b1b62033fa51579569/docs/image/preview.jpeg)

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-github-picker
```

The same command updates an existing installation to the latest published version; append `@<version>` to pin one. Restart `dsh web` after installing.

## Usage

Click the GitHub icon in the composer's tool row. The popup lists the repository's recent issues and PRs — 12 per page, loading the next page as you scroll to the bottom, no result cap — filtered locally as you type by number or title (a number prefix ranks first). Click a row to insert the reference; Escape or a click outside closes the popup. A search failure (gh CLI missing, not authenticated, rate limited, network error, unresolved repository) renders as one localized hint row instead of a silent close.

Each row shows GitHub's state icon, the title, and the `#number` tag:

| State | Icon |
| --- | --- |
| Open issue | `issue-opened` (green) |
| Closed issue | `issue-closed` (purple) |
| Open PR | `git-pull-request` (green) |
| Draft PR | `git-pull-request-draft` (gray) |
| Closed, unmerged PR | `git-pull-request-closed` (red) |
| Merged PR | `git-merge` (purple) |

Picking inserts the text chosen as **insert format** in Settings:

```text
@owner/name#125                                 # ref (default)
https://github.com/owner/name/issues/125        # url
```

Before each step, the Host scans the draft for GitHub references — URLs, `@owner/repo#number`, and bare `#number` — and adds a short message per match:

```xml
<github-reference repo="owner/name" number="125" />
```

Only the repository and number are passed; issue bodies are never fetched.

## Data Source

The **gh CLI** only: it reuses the local `gh` login and calls `gh api search/issues` (issues and PRs in one query). No device flow, OAuth app, or stored credential. The repository is resolved from the workspace's `git remote get-url origin` (https, ssh, `git@` forms); without a resolvable remote, the popup shows a hint row on adding one.

## Settings

The plugin card — titled "GitHub 引用" (or "GitHub Picker" in English) — lives in the official configurable-plugins tab. It shows the gh connection status (which accounts `gh auth status` reports) and the **insert format** (`@owner/repo#number` or `GitHub URL`). That is the only setting: there is no enable switch — the picker is always on — and no result limit.

## Configuration

Host options go into the selected profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: dsh-github-picker
  config:
    searchTimeoutMs: 15000
    repoCacheTtl: 30000
```

- `searchTimeoutMs` bounds provider calls (default 15000).
- `repoCacheTtl` caches the resolved repository per workspace (default 30000 ms).

A Host config change needs a `dsh web` restart; a client-only change just needs a browser refresh.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check
```

The check ladder is typecheck + tests + build with 100% coverage per source file; `lib/` is committed, so profile installs run without a build. For a local checkout, add the package to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/package.json` (dependency + `dsh.profile.bundles`), `pnpm install`, restart `dsh web`. The plugin serves at `/plugins/dsh-github-picker/client.js`, the gateway routes `/api/githubPicker/*`.
