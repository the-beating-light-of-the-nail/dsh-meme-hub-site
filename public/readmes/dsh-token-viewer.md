# dsh-token-viewer

CC Switch-style token consumption statistics for the **DeepSeek Harness Web GUI**. Read-only surfaces over the harness's host-computed projections plus one balance read; the plugin adds no prompt content, tools, or provider requests.

> **Install (one command):**
> ```
> dsh plugin add qwert702/dsh-token-viewer
> ```
> Restart the harness, refresh the web page, then open the **Token 消耗** card in the sidebar → **用量详情**.

## Features

- **TokenDock** — a slim live strip above the composer showing the current session's billed input (uncached + cache read + cache write), output, cache hit rate, and approximate context occupancy.
- **Sidebar card** — DeepSeek account balance (with refresh; error-retry when the host proxy fails) and aggregate consumption across all sessions, expandable to a per-conversation list.
- **Usage statistics panel** (right-side drawer, a faithful port of CC Switch's usage-dashboard method):
  - **Per-request statistics** — the host `usageLog` projection records one timestamped entry per reported assistant step (commit time, model, four token buckets); every figure folds these records, never cumulative session totals.
  - **Hero** — real consumption (fresh input + output + cache write + cache read), request count, total cost, over a five-card breakdown row with a cache-hit-rate progress bar.
  - **Trend chart** — requests bucketed by their own commit time (hourly for the day, daily otherwise, empty buckets zero-filled), four token series plus a dashed cost line.
  - **Three tabs** — request log (newest first; clicking a row opens that session), per-project statistics, and per-model statistics with average cost.
  - **Range presets** — today / 7d / 14d / 30d / all, resolved exactly like CC Switch (local midnight of N−1 days back).
- **Per-model peak/off-peak list pricing** — every request bills under its own model's provider list price (V4-Flash / V4-Pro, CNY per 1M tokens, cache writes at the cache-miss rate), split by the provider's Beijing peak windows (09:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00, double the off-peak rate); versioned model ids match by prefix, unknown models fall back to the V4-Flash off-peak table. Prices live in `MODEL_PRICING` (see below).
- **Balance route** — `GET /api/billing/balance` proxies DeepSeek's `/user/balance` through the harness credentials service; the API key never leaves the server.

## Repo layout

- `lib/index.js` — plugin host half (balance route + `modelUsage` / `usageLog` session projections), ready to load.
- `lib/client.js` — browser half bundle (built), discovered via `package.json` `dsh.client`.
- `scripts/build-client.mjs` — regenerates `lib/client.js` by vendoring the installed `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-sidebar` bundle (set `DSH_SIDEBAR_BUNDLE` or it probes `~/.dsh/profiles`).
- `test/smoke.cjs` — `node test/smoke.cjs`: host route + projections + SSR render checks.

The TypeScript monorepo source (extracted from `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`) lives on the `archive/monorepo-src` branch.

## Model pricing

`MODEL_PRICING` in `lib/client.js` (and `lib/index.js`'s projection fallback) holds the current DeepSeek list prices; the panel also fetches `GET /api/billing/pricing` and prefers the provider's official page when reachable, falling back to the built-in table otherwise.
