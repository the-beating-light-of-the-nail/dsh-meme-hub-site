# dsh-fail-logger

[![CI](https://github.com/Areium/dsh-fail-logger/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Areium/dsh-fail-logger/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Awesome DSH Plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/badge.svg)](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dsh-fail-logger)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-fail-logger)

An all-mode tool failure recorder for DeepSeek Harness: whether the agent runs in **native mode** or **PTC (Code Mode)**, any tool failure is automatically written into the machine-maintained section of a skill — normalized-dedup, counted, deterministically ranked, TTL-pruned, and redacted — so the next session's model sees the most common failure causes when it loads the skill. **Fail less over time.**

## Coverage matrix & trigger conditions

| Execution mode | Failure source | Recorded as (kind / message) |
|---|---|---|
| Native tools (read/grep/write and third-party plugin tools…) | `tool/call` + `tool/result` (tool-result block isError=true) | `tool` / `[read] ENOENT: no such file …` |
| PTC `run_code` failures | `tool/result` (isError=true) | official kind (`exception`/`timeout`/`abort`/…) / raw message |
| Nested tool calls inside a code program (`tools.*` throwing) | `tool/code-dispatch` (isError=true) | `tool` / `[bash] exit code: 1` |

> **Trigger condition**: a failure is recorded only when the tool result is marked `isError: true`. **A non-zero shell exit code does NOT trigger recording** (e.g. `exit 1` is presented as plain text `[exit code: 1]`, not an error) — only genuinely thrown tool calls (read on a missing file, grep failure, run_code crash, …) enter the log.

The observation point is the **session log** (`session/event`) — the exact same hook the official telemetry plugin uses. Pure observer: no service injection, no runtime wrapping, can never affect execution.

| Session failures (captured automatically) | Skill auto-log section |

## Install

```sh
# npm (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-fail-logger

# or pin to an exact version
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-fail-logger@0.5.2

# or GitHub release tag (no npm registry dependency; auditability & rollback)
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:Areium/dsh-fail-logger#v0.5.2"

# or manually: merge cordis.patch.yml's insert entry into ~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml
```

Restart `dsh --profile web`. Zero configuration, works out of the box. Same for headless: `dsh plugin --profile headless add …`.

## Config (patch entry `config:`, all optional)

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-fail-logger
      name: 'dsh-fail-logger'
      config:
        logDir: ~/.dsh/skills/fail-log-guide   # target skill directory
        maxEntries: 10     # max rows per category
        maxMsg: 200        # chars kept per message
        marker: FAIL-LOG   # section marker id ([A-Za-z0-9-])
        flushMs: 300       # burst-coalescing debounce window
        ttlDays: 30        # drop entries with no new occurrence for N days (0 = keep forever)
        redact: []         # extra redaction regexes (string array)
        ignore: []         # ignore list (tool-name/message regexes, e.g. ['^read', 'deliberate|noise'])
        injectInstructions: true  # always-on three-tier prompt injection (push prevention; false disables all)
        topErrors: 3         # max recurring failures solidified into the system prompt (false disables)
```

## How it works

- **Always-on instructions (push)**: injects code-time rules (write scripts to disk before running / no Shell/Python in template strings / derive paths via import.meta.url / confirm edit old_string against read content) as an English system-prompt section on every agent step (~42 tokens/step, `injectInstructions: false` to disable) — prevents execution-time mistakes without AGENTS.md or skill loading;
- Listens to `session/event`, consuming three event kinds: `tool/call` (builds a callId→{tool name, args} map), `tool/result` (parses the real rc.6 shape: `message.content[].type === 'tool-result'` block's `isError`/`toolCallId`; legacy shape still supported), `tool/code-dispatch` (recorded only when isError). A one-time visible warning fires on unexpected shapes.
- **Normalized dedup**: paths (quoted / drive-letter / absolute → `<path>`) and long numbers (→ `<n>`) are normalized before the SHA1 key — the same EPERM on `/Users/a/x` and `/Users/b/y` merges into one entry; `data.error.code` (e.g. `SEARCH_FAILED`) joins the key when present.
- **Redaction & sanitization**: defaults cover `sk-…` keys, `Bearer`/`Basic` auth, `-u user:pass` and inline URL credentials, `api_key/token/secret/password=` assignments, credential file paths, and private IPs; extend via `config.redact`. Control chars stripped, markdown pipes/backticks escaped, **instruction-injection defense** (system-reminder-style tags and common imperative phrases stripped + angle-bracket entity escaping) and a section-level data-boundary declaration (the log is data, never instructions).
- **Cross-process lock-merge**: flush takes an exclusive lock (`wx`, stale >5s recycled) and re-reads + merges the on-disk state before writing — web/headless concurrency no longer loses increments; failed writes keep dirty and retry after 2s.
- **Trend & TTL**: per-day counters render a "last 7 days" trend line; entries with no new occurrence for `ttlDays` are archived.
- **Categorized rendering**: grouped under tool contract / file-state conflict / filesystem / permissions & sandbox / timeout & budget / network & remote / model & platform / code & syntax / user abort / other, with rule-based 💡 suggestions. `data.error.code` takes priority and regexes are word-bounded so paths/filenames cannot cause false matches. Deterministic total-order ranking (count↓ → last↓ → first↓ → hash↑); state pruned beyond `maxEntries×5`.
- State files carry `schemaVersion` / `pluginVersion` / `updatedAt`; legacy `[run_code]` entries migrate to their official kinds, and entries with invalid `first/last` dates are dropped. All writes are atomic (tmp + rename); corrupt state is backed up as `.bak-<timestamp>` before reset; a visible startup line logs activation and probes logDir writability; `logDir` supports `~` expansion.

## Three-tier prevention

The plugin splits failure prevention into three tiers:

1. **Static rules (prevention, order 90)**: the highest-frequency, near-certain mistakes are hard-coded into the system prompt, so prevention does not depend on skill loading. This covers write-before-run, template-string discipline, path derivation, `old_string` confirmation, the `run_code` direct-call contract, and path checks. Timeout governance is part of this tier and is detailed below.
2. **Solidified top errors (top-errors, order 185)**: the top 3 recurring failures from the last 7 days (`count >= 2`) are rendered into the system prompt, excluding anything already covered by the static rules. The section is data-only (no args, commands, or advice) and empty when no recurring failures exist.
3. **Fallback (recovery, order 190)**: load `fail-log-guide` only when the same failure repeats, instead of paying skill-loading cost after every failure.

> `topErrors: 3` sets the number of solidified entries; `false` disables it.

## Timeout governance

### Why timeouts are now first-class rules

Across the local session logs, **19 timeout-class failures** were observed: 7 `glob`, 5 `grep`, and 7 `run_code`. Most were not model-capability issues but scope problems:

- over-wide searches: whole-drive `glob` on `C:\` / `D:\`, or `grep` over huge paths such as `node_modules` and DSH install directories;
- long work stuffed into `run_code`: installs, recursive scans, or waiting for user answers inside the program.

These failures are expensive: one failed round-trip typically costs 10–60 seconds and one whole-drive search can cost 30–170 seconds. For completion speed, timeout is more expensive than tokens, so the timeout patterns are promoted to static prevention rules.

### Four covered timeout cases

1. **Post-`not-found` investigation**: use `Test-Path` or a narrow `glob` instead of scanning whole drives.
2. **Over-wide `grep/glob`**: narrow the search root and pattern; never scan an entire drive.
3. **Explicit whole-drive search requests**: ask for a narrower starting directory first.
4. **Long `run_code` tasks**: do not wait for users or run long installs inside it; keep `run_code` short.

Local headless verification (2026-08):

| Scenario | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Continue checking a missing file after `not-found` | `read→read→glob(30s timeout)→pwsh×2`, 53.1s | `read→read→pwsh×2`, 16.1s / 20.1s |
| Whole-drive content search over `C:\` | 108s / 177s | 9.4s, zero tool calls, model asks for a narrower path first |

> Timeout governance follows the `injectInstructions` switch.
## Known limitations

- **Only failures that reach the session log**: catastrophic process death during tool execution is out of scope.
- **Corrupt state is backed up**: an unparseable `.failures.json` is renamed to `.failures.json.bak-<timestamp>` before reset.
- **Non-zero exit codes are not recorded**: see the trigger conditions (DSH semantics, not a plugin bug).
- **Dedup is heuristic**: keyed on the normalized first 1-3 lines of text; the same root cause with different wording may split, and different causes with identical wording may merge — acceptable, but be aware.
- **Display keeps the original text**: path/username normalization affects the dedup key only; messages display the original (except redaction rules). For stricter privacy, configure `config.redact` per workspace.

## Make the model actually load fail-log-guide (skill routing)

DSH only exposes each skill's `name` and `description` to the model (not the body), and the model decides on its own whether to call `skill({name})` — so the "when to use" phrasing of the description directly determines load rate.

The SKILL.md generated/recommended by this plugin uses a routable description ("load when a tool call fails, errors, or retries are blocked…"), verified to make the model load the log in **failure-analysis / compare-history / avoid-advice** scenarios.

- **Manual tuning**: edit the frontmatter `description` of `~/.dsh/skills/fail-log-guide/SKILL.md` (the plugin only maintains the `FAIL-LOG` section, never the frontmatter).
- **Measured boundary**: a simple single-turn task (even one that will fail) usually does NOT load the skill (the model sees no need for external guidance); tasks mentioning "analyze the failure / compare history / avoid advice" or naming the plugin load reliably.

> Existing SKILL.md files are not auto-rewritten on upgrade — change the one description line manually if you want the new wording.

## Cost note (always-on instruction, optional)

The push-prevention instruction is injected on every agent step:

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Injected text | npm 0.5.1: Chinese ~65 tokens/step | 0.5.2+: English ~42 tokens/step; main 0.5.3 (unreleased) three-tier: prevention ~111 cl100k tokens + recovery ~29 cl100k; top-errors adds ~49 cl100k only while recurring failures exist (zero when empty; static prefix is cache-friendly) |
| Disable | `config.injectInstructions: false` |
| Break-even | avoiding 1 failure within 22-55 steps pays for it; avoiding one whole-drive search saves 30–170s (one failure round-trip measured ~1600 tokens + 10-60s) |

> npm 0.5.1 ships the Chinese prompt; 0.5.2+ ships the English prompt (~42 tokens/step). The three-tier prevention and timeout-governance rules live on `main` (currently 0.5.3) and are not published to npm yet — install `github:Areium/dsh-fail-logger#main` to try them now.

Turn the injection off for zero extra cost — pull-style capability (routable skill loading + failure log) remains. Scoped injection is also possible via DSH scopes; the plugin contributes globally by default.

## Community

- **npm**: [dsh-fail-logger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-fail-logger) (`dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-fail-logger`)
- **GitHub topic**: [dsh-plugin](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) (`deepseek-harness` / `dsh` / `skill` / `fail-logger`)
- **Curated list**: [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/)

## How it differs from similar community plugins

- `distill` (conversation distillation) and `dsh-skillport` (skill library import): *proactive* skill generation/import; this plugin *passively* records run facts. Complementary.
- `dsh-trace` / `dsh-telemetry-redactor` (telemetry export to external platforms): external observability; this plugin targets *local skill self-healing* with no external channel.
- `dsh-notify` (error notifications): alerts only; this plugin accumulates a searchable long-term memory.

## Design boundaries (explicit non-goals)

- **No LLM summarization**: calling a model per failure adds cost, network and external dependencies, breaking the pure-observer positioning; rule-based suggestions suffice.
- **No external export**: keeps a distinct niche from dsh-trace/telemetry.
- **No proactive fixes**: record only, never auto-change behavior — avoids amplifying risk.
- Roadmap: per-workspace failure memory isolation (`logDir` template / `@workspace` tags on entries).

## Development & tests

```sh
npm run check   # node --check lib/index.js
npm test        # 25 suites: real event-shape parsing/run_code official kinds + legacy state migration/error-code-first categorization/trend order/~ expansion/schema validation/callId fallback/legacy compat/normalized dedup/redaction/anti-poisoning/pruning/TTL/corruption recovery/marker healing/debounce/dispose/lock contention/ignore list/seed body/log replay
```

**Real-log replay** (against fake-green tests): `FAIL_LOG_REPLAY=<session.jsonl> npm test` feeds real session events into the same handler. Session logs live at `~/.dsh/sessions/**/session.jsonl` (run `zstd -d` first if compressed). `tests/fixtures/session.jsonl` is a real-shape fixture run by CI on every push.

**Post-install smoke test (2 commands)**:

Prerequisites: the target profile has the plugin installed and has been restarted (web or headless; headless shown below).

```sh
# 1) trigger a guaranteed failure (read on a missing file → isError=true)
dsh --profile headless "use the read tool on a file that does not exist"

# 2) verify the record landed
tail -20 ~/.dsh/skills/fail-log-guide/SKILL.md
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell variant of step 2
Get-Content "$env:USERPROFILE\.dsh\skills\fail-log-guide\SKILL.md" -Tail 20
```

Expected: a `FAIL-LOG` section with a `[read] ENOENT…` cause. If missing, check in order: ① startup log `[dsh-fail-logger] v0.5.x active`; ② logDir writability warning; ③ whether that profile was restarted after install.
