# dsh-rewind

In-place conversation rewind for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness): Claude Code's `/rewind` semantics inside the **same session window** — cut the model context back to an earlier user message, and optionally restore workspace files from disk-persisted before-backups.

> English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A deliberately focused plugin with one job: rewind to any earlier user message, in place.

| Mode | Conversation | Workspace files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rewind conversation only** | Cut back to the target message | Untouched |
| **Rewind conversation and code** | Cut back to the target message | Restored to their state before it (modified files written back, later-created files deleted) |

Rewinding is time-travel: the target message and everything after it (agent replies, tool calls) are withdrawn from the model context *and* the rendered transcript — no new session, no window switch — and the target's text is offered back in the composer so you can edit and re-send it.

The plugin never rewrites the append-only session log and never touches your git repository.

## Preview

Each user message gains a compact **↶ rewind** action in its action row. Clicking it opens a mode-selection popover; "conversation and code" first shows the exact restore / delete list for confirmation (the option is hidden when there are no tracked changes — like Claude Code's code-restore visibility).

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-rewind-plugin
```

Restart `dsh web` (`--profile web`) after installing.

> ⚠️ The npm name `dsh-rewind` belongs to another author's package — install with `dsh-rewind-plugin`.

For contributors: install from a local checkout or a pinned commit — `dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-rewind` or `dsh plugin --profile web add github:SiriLee/dsh-rewind#<sha>`. A git install fails on first run until you add an `allowBuilds` key to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (pnpm blocks git dependencies from running build scripts); after that it runs the plugin's `prepare` and installs it.

## Usage

1. **Hover** any user message you sent — a **↶ rewind** button appears in its action row.
2. **Click it.** The target is that message; a small popover offers the two modes ("conversation and code" is hidden when no tracked file changes exist after the target).
3. The rewind executes as an in-session command; a result message confirms, and the withdrawn message's text is filled back into the composer for editing and re-sending.

**Command-line entry**: type a bare `/rewind` and press Enter to open the candidate picker; selecting a target continues the same flow as the button.

Both the candidate picker and the mode popover support the keyboard: ↑↓ to move, Enter to confirm, Esc to cancel/back.

Rewinds can be repeated (each appends a marker to the log). A rewind cannot be undone through the plugin, but the withdrawn messages can be recovered by manually editing the session log. The file-restore action is not re-backed up.

## How it works

### 1. Conversation rewind (in-place)

The plugin appends an **empty-content marker** `assistant/message` into the session log whose `surfaceOp: { op: 'replace', start, end }` replaces every surface node after the target message with the marker:

- The marker carries `sourceEventSeqs` covering every shadowed node, and `Session.append`'s surface rules validate the cut (a contiguous range on the current surface).
- Because the marker is **empty**, the harness derives it to `null` — it never enters the model context and never renders as conversation content. Agent and user both see the conversation exactly as it was at the target.
- The marker's **turn number reuses the last started turn** (`markerTurnOf`), never `lastTurn + 1`: the harness numbers its next real turn exactly `last turn/start + 1`, so a `maxTurn + 1` marker would sit *before* that `turn/start` — the client conversation builder rejects the ordering (`…turn-tail… received an update before its start Match`) and history load fails. Reusing an already-consumed turn makes the marker a harmless trailing update on the previous completed turn's tail — it can never collide with a future turn.
- The marker rides a **ghost step frame** — its own `step/start` … `step/end` with a fresh step number (`markerStepOf`) — because the harness token-meter requires every `assistant/message` to sit inside an open step of the same turn/step; a bare idle-time marker would fail its replay and break `/compact` for the session.
- The append-only log is **untouched** — every withdrawn event stays in the audit trail; only the model-visible surface is cut, so the next request derives its context from the target onward.

A running turn (LLM thinking / streaming) is force-stopped first (`cancel({ kind: 'user' })`) and the rewind waits for quiescence; if it can't stop, the rewind is aborted with an error.

### 2. Checkpoint file restore

The plugin tracks the write-class tools — `write`, `edit`, `str_replace_editor` (mutating commands `create` / `str_replace` / `insert`):

1. **Before-capture** at `tools/execute` (the around-dispatch stage): the target file is read; the resolved path + content are held in a pending map. This stage runs only after any pre-execute approval gate let the call through — an `ask` short-circuit (dsh-edit-approval) **cannot skip** the backup, and a denied call never records. If the read fails (e.g. a permission error), the change is simply not backed up — the plugin warns in the log but **does not block the write**.
2. **Disk commit** at `tools/post-execute`: the before-backup is written under the turn's anchor message seq (`~/.dsh/rewind-snapshots/<session>/<anchor seq>/<callId>.json`).
3. **Restore** (`/rewind @<seq> both`): every backup anchored at or after the target applies once reconciled with the current disk — modified files are written back to their **earliest** captured before-state, files created after the target are deleted, files already matching the target state are left untouched (idempotent). Symbolic / hard links are skipped (they share an inode with another name; restoring through one would clobber both). Writes go through plain `node:fs`, independent of the fs service — under sandbox / remote backends, path resolution may be restricted.
4. A tool body that **throws** skips `tools/post-execute`; a `tools/result` safety net clears the pending capture so nothing leaks in memory.

Backups persist across host restarts, bounded to the newest 100 anchor groups per session.

## What it deliberately does NOT do

- **Whole-tree / git-first snapshots** — only write-class tool edits plus external changes to already-tracked files are backed up; files never touched by a tool are not restored: the same limitation as Claude Code, which defers such rollbacks to the user's git.
- **Subagent edits** — not tracked (same as Claude Code): a subagent runs its own session, so its backups could never be restored by a rewind of the parent session.
- **Fork / branch rewind and `/compact`** — the harness already provides these ("branch in new chat", compact).

## Comparison with similar projects

[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) also has [Anionex/dsh-turn-rewind](https://github.com/Anionex/dsh-turn-rewind) — a rewind plugin with the same user-facing idea (a per-message action that rolls the conversation back and restores workspace files), but a different approach:

| Dimension | dsh-rewind (this plugin) | Anionex dsh-turn-rewind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Conversation rollback | **In-place, same session/window** — the model-visible surface is cut back to the target; the append-only log is untouched | **Forks a new Session** at the previous `turn/end`; the original session is always retained |
| File-restore engine | **Lightweight before-backups** of write-class tools only, restored via plain `node:fs` | **Change Ledger** — a durable restore-point engine with Git fences, an approval gate, rescue points and crash reconciliation |
| Tracked-change scope | Only write-class tool edits (like Claude Code) | Any Git-managed file (Git worktree required) |
| Public service API | No — a focused single-purpose plugin | Yes — `ctx.changeLedger` service + `/turn-rewind` HTTP endpoint |

The essential difference: dsh-turn-rewind keeps the log immutable and therefore forks a new session; this plugin cuts the model-visible surface in place with an empty marker, so the original conversation continues in the same window — the non-trivial part (see [Known issues](#known-issues)) that dsh-turn-rewind sidesteps.

## Compatibility

- Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`.
- DeepSeek Harness web profile (`dsh --profile web`); peer `@deepseek-ai/*` packages are resolved by the harness at runtime.

> [!WARNING]
> This project and DeepSeek Harness are both in developer preview. Pin exact
> versions in reproducible environments and review the behavior notes above.

## Client contract

Third-party DOM plugins that need to know which transcript rows a rewind
withdrew should consume the stable, locale-independent helpers exported from
`dsh-rewind-plugin/client` (`hiddenSeqsOf`, `targetSeqOfArgs`) — never parse
`outcome.text`. The `data-dsh-rewind-hidden` attribute marks withdrawn rows
(observational only). Details: [docs/client-contract.md](docs/client-contract.md).

## Known issues

Rewinds created with versions `≤ v0.2.4` could corrupt client replay when followed by more conversation (a marker turn collides with the next `turn/start`). Only pre-upgrade sessions are affected. The offline repair tool (`dsh-rewind-repair`) was shipped before v0.4.0 and is no longer provided from v0.4.0 on — install a pre-v0.4.0 release if you need it ([docs/troubleshooting.md](docs/troubleshooting.md)).

Rewinds from `≤ v0.3.3` appended a bare marker (no step frame); the harness token-meter rejects such a log on replay, so `/compact` fails for that session. Newer versions are compatible; affected old sessions have no online repair yet — start a new session.

## Security

This plugin only appends rewind-marker events to the session log; it never deletes or rewrites logged history. Workspace files are written only when you choose "conversation and code"; backups and restores stay under `~/.dsh/rewind-snapshots/`. It never touches your git repository, makes no network requests, and accesses no credentials.

> **Note:** a rewind only hides messages from view — the exported session log (`/export`) still contains them, and this plugin cannot alter exports. To remove a conversation completely, delete its session file.

## Development

```sh
npm install            # devDeps from the npm registry
npm run typecheck      # tsc on all three surfaces (host + client + client-test)
npm test               # vitest: rewind / snapshot / hidden / session-cwd / integration / compat-invariants / compat-interop
npm run build          # esbuild: lib/index.js (host ESM) + lib/client.js (loader closure) + .d.ts
node scripts/verify-host.mjs   # boot the BUILT host artifact end-to-end (incl. real /compact after rewind)
```

`npm test` and `verify-host` include the **compatibility probe suites**
([docs/compat-audit.md](docs/compat-audit.md)): scenario-generated logs drive the
real harness packages (token-meter, compaction, session-stats/title/goal folds,
resume preflight) through rewind markers and assert the compatibility
invariants. A failing probe is a discovered incompatibility, not a mock
artifact. One finding is recorded: **R-OPENSTEP** — a log carrying an
unclosed `step/start` (crash leftover) makes any later step activity,
including a rewind's ghost-step frame, break token-meter replay (and
/compact). Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` fixes the crash path (`interruptedTurnClosers`
closes leftover step/turn boundaries on load). A plugin-side guard was tried
and reverted: it produced false positives on real session logs (rewind
feature broken), so the plugin deliberately ships no guard — the residual
risk (runtime-produced unclosed steps) is accepted.

`prepare` runs the full build, so git installs and `npm pack` / `npm publish` always produce a complete `lib/` and the `LICENSE`.
