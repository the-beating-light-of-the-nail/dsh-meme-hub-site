A plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

## Features

- **Automatic description** — the wrapper adapter recursively describes uploaded images and image-bearing tool results in a model-bound copy while the visible chat keeps the originals.
- **In-conversation lifecycle cards** — automatic analysis appears immediately below its source image and settles in place as success or failure; one logical analysis produces one card.
- **Intent-aware prompts** — send an image *with a question* and the description is generated from your own words.
- **`vision_describe` tool** — the model can answer a later follow-up question when the automatic description lacks the requested detail.
- **Plugin-owned video upload** — accepts MP4, M4V, MOV, AVI, MPG/MPEG, MKV, and WebM only when extension, signature, and FFprobe agree.
- **Scene-aware video analysis** — normalizes to H.264/yuv420p MP4, extracts keyframes with PySceneDetect, asks the vision model for timestamped evidence, and lets the current DSH text model answer.
- **Right-side panel** — switch between image/video cards, play normalized videos directly, stage a selected video in the chat draft, and inspect dependency health.
- **Secrets stay secret** — the API key lives in the harness credentials seam (write-only, never echoed).

## How it works

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyh20030112/dsh-visual-plugin/a4ffdbd4e3f83f741f29cb48f0c8d0d2813842e1/assets/vision-bridge-flow.svg" width="720" alt="Animated demo of the vision bridge in dsh web: the user sends an image, the vision bridge auto-describes it, and the main model answers from the description">
</p>

```
image in composer or tool result → wrapper finds it at any content depth → visible message keeps the image
  → adapter stream → readImage → vision API → "[视觉描述] …" in the private model request only
  → text-only model answers → /vision-bridge/recent → panel thumbnail + description (2s poll)
```

Unconfigured or failed calls degrade to a `[视觉描述失败] <reason>` placeholder, so the conversation never breaks.

## Quick start

Video support requires FFmpeg/FFprobe `>= 6.1` from the same major release (with `libx264`) and PySceneDetect `>= 0.7.1 < 0.8` installed on the host:

```sh
ffmpeg -version
ffprobe -version
python -m pip install 'scenedetect[opencv]>=0.7.1,<0.8'
scenedetect version
```

The plugin never downloads these tools or runs installers. Image features remain available when they are missing, and the settings card reports each video dependency issue.

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-visual-plugin   # or: github:jyh20030112/dsh-visual-plugin
```

When developing this checkout against a local DeepSeek Harness source tree, install the local package instead:

```sh
cd /absolute/path/to/dsh-visual-plugin
npm run bootstrap
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-visual-plugin
```

`bootstrap` automatically finds a sibling or ancestor-adjacent Harness checkout.
For another layout, set its location explicitly:

```sh
HARNESS=/absolute/path/to/deepseek-harness npm run bootstrap
```

Restart `dsh web`, then:

1. Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration** and expand the **Vision Bridge** card:

   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jyh20030112/dsh-visual-plugin/a4ffdbd4e3f83f741f29cb48f0c8d0d2813842e1/assets/vision-bridge-config.png" width="560" alt="Vision Bridge configuration card in the settings plugin configuration tab">

2. Fill in the endpoint URL, the vision model name, and the API key. The **侧边栏 / Sidebar** toggle shows or hides the image-history panel; the history limit defaults to 20, and leaving it empty means unlimited. Click **保存 / Save**, then **测试连接 / Test connection**.
3. In the model picker, select provider **DeepSeek (Vision)** — the plugin's wrapper adapter declares image input so the gateway admits uploads.
4. Send an image (optionally with a question). The model answers from the generated description, and the image-history panel shows the thumbnail + description within ~2s.
5. Upload video from the video button beside the composer. Once processing finishes, select **Videos** in the right panel to play it; **Ask in chat** stages a draft and never submits automatically.

### Reference local model

This project is developed and tested with a locally deployed
[Empero AI Qwythos-9B](https://huggingface.co/empero-ai/Qwythos-9B-Claude-Mythos-5-1M)
as the vision backend. Its SGLang deployment can expose an OpenAI-compatible
`/v1` endpoint; enter the endpoint URL and the server's registered model name
(for example, `Qwythos`) in the Vision Bridge panel. The plugin is not tied to
Qwythos-9B and can use any compatible vision model.

## Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-visual-plugin
```

Restart `dsh web`. The command forwards to `pnpm remove` inside the profile, and the bundle layer list reconciles to drop the plugin automatically.

## Project layout

```

## Build

```sh
npm run bootstrap && npm run typecheck && npm run build   # needs a local harness checkout
```

Prebuilt `lib/` is committed, so consumers never build.

## CI/CD

`ci.yml` verifies artifacts and the pack contents on every push/PR. `release.yml` (tag `v*`) checks the version, packs, creates a GitHub Release, and publishes to npm.
