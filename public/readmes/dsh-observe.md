## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Backends | OpenTelemetry OTLP/HTTP (traces + metrics, JSON encoding) and Langfuse (LLM observability) — either or both |
| Model | Model-agnostic: it exports the session/event stream; no model calls are made |

## What you get

`dsh-observe` turns the harness's `session/event` stream into standard observability protocols:

- **Spans** — turn, step, tool-call (duration, status, retry derivation), and LLM generation spans, linked into per-turn traces with deterministic ids.
- **Metrics** — per-provider/model token counters, USD cost counters (configurable pricing table), and the optional context-pressure gauge from `ctx.tokenMeter`.
- **Sanitized capture** — prompt and completion bodies are redacted (structural key names + built-in secret patterns + your patterns) and truncated before anything is queued or sent.
- **Reliability** — async batching (size- and timer-triggered), a bounded durable offline buffer (storage-domain) with oldest-first eviction, and deterministic exponential-backoff retries; undeliverable batches survive restarts.
- **Runtime kill switch** — the optional Typert remote (`observe/status`, `observe/setEnabled`) lets a settings page stop and resume exporting without unmounting.
- **Off by default** — `enabled: true` plus at least one backend is an explicit opt-in; nothing is captured or exported otherwise.

```

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-observe#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-observe

# 2. configure a backend in your profile patch (cordis.yml) and restart
dsh --profile web
```

Minimal OTLP configuration (the row ships commented out in `cordis.patch.yml`):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: dsh-observe
      name: dsh-observe
      config:
        enabled: true
        otlp:
          endpoint: http://localhost:4318
```

Then verify the row mounts:

```sh
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A2 'id: dsh-observe'
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-observe#main"` — the `prepare` script builds with production dependencies only.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-observe`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in this repo, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-observe-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-observe` (or remove the row from the profile patch).

> If pnpm reports `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS` for this package (esbuild's harmless platform-binary validation), add `allowBuilds: { esbuild: true }` to your `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — the `dsh` CLI prints the exact snippet.

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). An id-targeted override replaces the whole row — restate every key you need. `cordis.patch.yml` documents each key inline.

## Tools & surfaces

This plugin registers **no model tools** — it is a background exporter. Its surfaces:

- **Consumes** `session/event` (span/metric collection), `session/flush` (best-effort export kick — the durability checkpoint never waits on a remote backend), and `session/disposed`.
- **Optional remote service** `observe` — `observe/status` returns the kill-switch state, configured backends, queue depths, and buffer occupancy; `observe/setEnabled` stops and resumes exporting at runtime.

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: `network:outbound` to the endpoints you configure, `session:read` for the event stream, `storage:write` for the offline buffer; no native code, no filesystem access.
- **Data**: everything sent is derived from the session log and sanitized (redaction + truncation) before it is queued, buffered, or transmitted. The offline buffer stores only sanitized records, re-validated when read back.
- **Credentials**: Langfuse public/secret keys travel only to the configured Langfuse endpoint; OTLP headers only to the configured OTLP endpoint. The plugin stores no credentials itself — keep them in credential references or environment-injected values.

## Security boundaries

- **Off by default** — nothing is captured or exported unless you opt in explicitly.
- **Sanitize before send** — structural key redaction, built-in secret patterns (API keys, GitHub tokens, AWS keys, bearer credentials, private keys), your patterns, and character budgets all apply before any record leaves memory.
- **Durable boundary re-validation** — records read back from storage are checked again before a sink can see them.
- **Failure loud, failure contained** — export failures warn, count, retry, and finally spool; a failing session handler is caught and logged so observability can never break the harness hot path.
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged** — prompt/completion exports project only the logged header and the session surface; the exporter invents no content.

## Known limitations

- **rc.2 only** — the plugin is developed and tested against `@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2`; newer harness baselines are expected to work but are verified by the monthly compat workflow.
- **Metrics bypass the retry/spool path** — OTLP metrics are aggregated cumulatively, so a lost flush self-heals on the next one (by design, not a bug).
- **No sampling** — every enabled span family is exported; set `capture.*` switches and `batch.maxBufferRecords` for high-volume sessions.
