In-session question navigator for the [DeepSeek Harness (DSH) Web GUI][dsh]: a
vertical column of small round dots overlaid on the **left edge** of the
conversation column — one dot per user question. Hover a dot to magnify it
(together with its two neighbors on each side) and reveal a vertical cascade
of crisp question cards with each question's **full text** and **sent time**
(clicking any card jumps to it); click a dot to scroll the chat to that
question.

It is an external plugin bundle with zero runtime dependencies — the browser
half (`lib/client.js`) externalizes everything to the DSH shell, so it adds
only a small bundle to the GUI at load time.

Package: **`@luziyang2026/dsh-question-nav`** ([npm][npm] · [GitHub][github]).

## What it does

- **Left-edge dot minimap** (embedded, not reserving any width). The rail's
  anchor edge is configurable — **Settings → Plugins → Question Nav → Rail
  alignment** switches it between the left and right edge of the conversation
  column.
- **Height-capped and scrollable**: the dot column is vertically centered and
  uses at most **60%** of the conversation height; longer sessions scroll
  inside that band (wheel over the dots or the gaps between them).
- **One dot = one turn that asked a question** (strictly aligned with the
  Trajectory view's turn numbering), with a small count above the dot column.
- **Full history, persisted, no render-window expansion**: the plugin's host
  half registers a `questionIndex` session projection — the projection
  registry folds the whole event log (read-only, the chat's paged window is
  never touched), the official projection cache persists it across restarts,
  and push frames deliver new questions live.
- **Hover (focus)**: the dot and its **two neighbors on each side** magnify
  progressively (selected largest), the rail scrolls the selection into view
  only when clipped by the band's edges, and a
  **vertical cascade of five crisp question cards** (portal-rendered, no
  native-title delay) appears beside the rail — one card per window dot,
  stacked top-to-bottom without overlap and centered on the selected dot. Each
  card shows the turn's **full question text** (all of them, when one turn
  batched several) and the question's **sent time** (`HH:MM` on the same day,
  `MM-DD HH:MM` across days, `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` across years). The hierarchy
  is two-tier: the **center card is the focus** — full-contrast text, a brand
  accent bar and a raised shadow — while the four neighbors are clean
  **context cards** (same surface, narrower, fewer lines) that light up on
  hover to show they are clickable too. **Clicking any card jumps to that
  question** exactly like clicking its dot.
- **Click**: jumps to that question. Only then does the jump loop page the
  window (`loadOlder()`) to bring that specific page into view — never the
  whole history up front.
- **Paged overflow**: when many dots don't fit the 60% band, the native
  scrollbar is hidden and two small triangle buttons in the dot style appear —
  **▲ above the dot queue and ▼ below it** — each click revealing the next
  page of hidden dots, which pop in with a short staggered animation as click
  feedback. The page size is configurable — **Settings → Plugins → Question
  Nav → Dots per page** (3 / 5 / 8 / 10, default 5). The triangles themselves
  are the overflow cue — each appears only while its direction has more dots
  to reveal (wheel and trackpad still scroll too); **hovering never scrolls
  the band**, so the dots stay put while you browse.
- Empty/left areas of the rail pass pointer events through to the conversation
  (it never blocks the chat).

## Requirements

- DeepSeek Harness Web GUI (a runnable DSH profile; the `dsh` CLI).
- Node.js `>= 20` (matches the DSH SDK peer range).

## Install

Install the prebuilt package from npm and add it to a profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @luziyang2026/dsh-question-nav
```

Then restart the DSH Web GUI to load the new bundle.

### Build from source / develop locally

This repository is a standalone plugin project — build it, then add the
checkout to a profile as an installable [bundle][bundle]:

```sh
pnpm install       # install devDependencies (DSH SDK peers, tsdown, vitest)
pnpm build         # tsc declarations + tsdown client bundle -> lib/
```

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-question-nav
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test          # vitest run
pnpm build         # build host lib/index.js + client lib/client.js
```

## How it is built

The client half uses the shared DSH client-bundle preset
([`tsdown.client.ts`](tsdown.client.ts), vendored into this repo), which emits
a `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })` closure-factory
artifact with CSS Modules inlined and externals resolved through the loader
module table.
