# dsh-web-fetch-playwright

[中文](./README.zh-CN.md) · [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-web-fetch-playwright) · [GitHub](https://github.com/chendefine/dsh-web-fetch-playwright)

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) plugin that gives the built-in `web_fetch` tool a **Playwright/CDP backend**: pages are rendered in a real browser, denoised with **Readability + DOMPurify + Turndown + GFM**, and returned as Markdown.

## Features

- **Real browser rendering** — loads the page the way a user sees it, so client-side rendered (SPA) content is captured, not just the raw HTML.
- **Denoise pipeline** — Mozilla Readability extracts the article, DOMPurify removes layout/noise tags (nav, sidebar, footer, ads, forms), and Turndown with the GFM plugin converts to Markdown with the same style options as the shipped `tool-web` renderer. Inline `data:` images (build tools like Docusaurus embed screenshots as base64) are elided to size placeholders such as `![alt](data:image/png;base64,...8.9KB)` so they cannot flood the body.
- **Two backends** — launch a local Playwright browser, or drive an already-running browser over its DevTools Protocol (CDP) endpoint.
- **Browser resolution** — a configured path, a `playwright` CLI on `$PATH`, or the bundled `playwright-core`; CDP needs no local browser at all.
- **Isolated or profile sessions (CDP)** — every fetch is scoped to exactly one tab. Local launches close their browser per fetch; the CDP backend keeps **one shared connection** to the remote browser and each fetch opens a tab inside it, closed when done. By default that tab lives in the remote browser's **real profile** (its cookies, localStorage, and persistent logins apply — like `playwright-cli open`); unchecking *Share the browser context* switches to a throwaway isolated context per fetch.
- **Live configuration** — a settings card (设置 → 插件 → 插件配置) edits the backend, context mode, denoise toggle, and concurrency; changes apply to the next fetch without a restart.
- **Budget-aware** — per-fetch deadline (45s); concurrency is backend-priced (`maxConcurrency`, default 4 local browsers / **50 CDP tabs**; queued fetches fail fast with a retry hint after 20s instead of hanging); image/font/media subrequests aborted; body capped at 100k chars.
- **Bounded Cloudflare-challenge wait** — when a navigation lands on a challenge interstitial ("Just a moment…" and its localized siblings, recognized via the documented `cf-mitigated: challenge` response header plus structural page markers), the fetch keeps the **same tab and context** and waits for the browser's own verification to clear it — tracking the *last* main-frame response (the real page reloads in) and watching the live DOM so SPA-style clears are caught too. Bounded and configurable (`challengeWaitMs`, default 15s; 0 restores the legacy first-response behavior), with a bounded same-tab retry (`challengeRetries`, default 1). When the budget runs out, the fetch fails with the distinct `WEB_FETCH_CHALLENGE` error code instead of returning the interstitial as content. It never clicks, never injects CAPTCHA answers, never fakes browser state, and never exports or copies cookies.

## How it works

| Half | Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host (server) | `src/` | Registers the fetch provider (id `playwright`) into `ctx.web`; `cordis.patch.yml` pins the web seam's `fetchProvider` to it and enables the `web_fetch` tool with a 60s budget. |
| Browser (client) | `src/client/` | Registers the *Playwright 网页爬取* configuration card, which hot-writes the settings section into `$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`. |

```
web_fetch (tool-web)
   └─ ctx.web.fetchProvider = playwright
        ├─ local: resolve (path → $PATH → bundled playwright-core) → chromium.launch
        ├─ cdp:   connectOverCDP(endpoint)
        ├─ page.goto → settle (networkidle, best-effort) → page.content()
        ├─ denoise: jsdom → elide data-URI images → Readability → DOMPurify → Turndown(GFM)
        └─ Markdown (or raw HTML when denoise is off)
```

## Requirements

- DSH web profile (`dsh web`), Node.js ≥ 20.
- For the **local** backend: a Playwright installation with Chromium, a Chromium-family browser binary, or `playwright-core` with a browser in the default cache.
- For the **CDP** backend: any browser already running with `--remote-debugging-port` (e.g. `chromium --headless --remote-debugging-port=9222`).

## Installation

From the npm registry (prebuilt — no build permission needed):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-web-fetch-playwright
```

From a GitHub repository (source — pnpm runs the `prepare` build; allowlist the package in `profiles/web/pnpm-workspace.yaml` if pnpm blocks the build script):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:chendefine/dsh-web-fetch-playwright
```

Or through the DSH plugin marketplace (设置 → DSH插件市场) — the repo carries the `dsh-plugin` topic and is indexed automatically.

After a bundle plugin is added to the profile layer stack, **restart `dsh web`** for it to load; uninstall with `dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-web-fetch-playwright` and restart again.

## Configuration

The settings card (设置 → 插件 → 插件配置 → *Playwright 网页爬取*) edits the `web-fetch-playwright` settings section live:

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `backend` | `local` | Radio: *Local Playwright* or *Remote CDP endpoint*, each with its own nested input. |
| `playwrightPath` | (blank) | Local backend: path to a `playwright` executable or a Chromium-family browser binary. Blank = discover on `$PATH`, then fall back to the bundled `playwright-core`. |
| `cdpEndpoint` | `127.0.0.1:9222` | Remote backend: `host:port`, `http(s)://…` or `ws(s)://…`. |
| `shareBrowserContext` | `true` | CDP backend only. **Checked (profile mode)**: each fetch is a tab in the remote browser's default context — its real profile — so cookies/localStorage are shared and its persistent logins apply; only the tab closes when the fetch ends. **Unchecked (isolated mode)**: a fresh incognito-like context per fetch, nothing shared. Local backend ignores this field. |
| `denoise` | `true` | Run the denoise pipeline; off returns the full rendered HTML for the tool layer to convert. |
| `maxConcurrency` | *(auto)* | How many fetches may render at once (1–200). Blank = backend default: **4** for local (each slot launches a browser) / **50** for CDP (each slot is just a tab in the already-running remote browser). Beyond the limit, fetches wait briefly; if no slot frees within 20s they fail with `WEB_FETCH_TIMEOUT` and a hint to retry or raise this setting, rather than hanging until the tool budget aborts. |
| `challengeWaitMs` | `15000` | Bounded wait (ms, 0–60000) for a Cloudflare challenge to clear naturally in the same tab. `0` disables the whole challenge path — the first response is returned as-is (the pre-0.2.5 behavior). |
| `challengeRetries` | `1` | Same-tab re-navigation attempts after a wait window runs out (0–3); any clearance cookies the browser earned stay in the context for the retry. Everything stays inside the 45s per-fetch deadline. |

Local backend resolution order:

1. The configured path (auto-detected as Playwright CLI or browser binary).
2. A `playwright` executable on `$PATH` (its package knows that installation's browser registry).
3. The bundled `playwright-core` — requires `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` or browsers in the default cache; otherwise the error suggests `playwright install chromium`.

> **Windows note** — `$PATH` is scanned with the platform delimiter (`;`), but npm/pnpm global installs expose `playwright` as `.cmd`/`.ps1` shims whose location does not walk up to the package root, so discovery may still land on step 3 (the bundled core). To drive a specific installation's browser registry, point `playwrightPath` at the `playwright` package directory or a browser executable.

CDP mode needs no local browser: the provider holds **one shared connection** for its lifetime (reconnecting automatically if it drops, and reconnecting to the new endpoint when the setting changes), and every fetch leases a tab in the remote browser that closes when the fetch completes. Concurrency therefore counts tabs, which is why the CDP default is high (50). Unloading the plugin drops the shared connection (the remote browser itself is never closed).

### The CDP context modes (share the browser's profile or not)

With *Share the browser context* **checked** (default, profile mode), each fetch is a tab in the remote browser's default context — the real profile. Cookies and localStorage come from and are written back to that profile, so sites the browser is logged into are fetched logged-in, exactly like a tab you open by hand. The shared context is never closed; resource filtering and popup guards attach to the fetch's tab only, so your other tabs are untouched. With it **unchecked** (isolated mode), every fetch gets a fresh incognito-like context — anonymous reads, nothing persists.

**Profile-mode risk notes** — it upgrades `web_fetch` from "anonymous read" to "acts as the browser's logged-in user":

- A fetched page that talks the agent into a GET-style state-changing URL (logout, settings change, API call) will send it with your session cookies.
- Concurrent fetches to the same site share one cookie jar; one fetch's logout or `Set-Cookie` affects the others.
- Output starts depending on the browser's history (A/B buckets, language preferences). The remote profile also keeps accumulating site data; the plugin never cleans it.

Persistent logins require a persistent user-data-dir. Headful (recommended — log in by hand once):

```sh
google-chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="$HOME/.config/chrome-dsh-profile"
```

Headless server (pre-seed logins in a headful environment first): `chromium --headless=new --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/data/chrome-dsh-profile`. Do **not** add `--incognito` or a throwaway user-data-dir — either defeats profile mode. Design notes and verified playwright-core facts live in [`docs/context-mode-profile.md`](./docs/context-mode-profile.md).

### Cloudflare challenge handling (bounded natural wait)

Some strict sites serve a Cloudflare interstitial before the real page. A real browser often passes the check on its own within a few seconds — but a fetch that only looks at the first response hands you the interstitial as if it were the page (the pre-0.2.5 behavior; reproduce it any time with `challengeWaitMs: 0`, or — from a repo checkout, after `pnpm build` — run `node scripts/challenge-demo.mjs` for a local simulated before/after, and `node scripts/challenge-online.mjs <url>` against a real site).

With the wait on (default):

1. **Detection** — a response carrying `cf-mitigated: challenge` (the documented signal for every challenge page type), or a 403/503 HTML document from a `server: cloudflare` edge, or the localized interstitial itself (title family like "Just a moment…", `请稍候…`, "Минутку…", plus structural markers: `/cdn-cgi/challenge-platform/` scripts, `#challenge-*` elements, `cf-chl-widget-` frames, `window._cf_chl_opt`). The content-level markers are the *fallback tier* and only run on challenge-compatible responses — 403/429/503 or a Cloudflare edge (`server: cloudflare` / `cf-ray`) — because interstitials never ship as a plain 200, so an ordinary article that merely quotes challenge text can never be mistaken for one. A hard block ("Sorry, you have been blocked") is classified separately and fails immediately.
2. **Bounded wait, same tab and context** — the fetch polls the live DOM (500ms interval) for the challenge to disappear while the browser runs its own verification; the *last* main-frame navigation response is tracked so the reloaded real document's status and headers are the ones reported. SPA-style clears (content swapped without any navigation) are caught by the same DOM probe.
3. **Bounded retry** — when a window runs out, the same tab re-navigates once (default; `challengeRetries`) with whatever clearance cookies the context already holds.
4. **Clear failure** — `WEB_FETCH_CHALLENGE` (a provider-specific code the web seam's open-string `code` allows) naming the site, the budget spent, and the last challenge status.

Security boundary (deliberate): no clicking through Turnstile, no CAPTCHA solving or token injection, no fingerprint/UA spoofing, no proxy rotation, and no cookie export — in isolated mode the clearance a fetch's browser earns dies with that fetch's context; in profile mode it stays in the remote browser's own profile, which this plugin never copies or cleans. The wait is always bounded by `challengeWaitMs` and the 45s per-fetch deadline; nothing blocks forever.

## Security

Same stance as the built-in HTTP provider: **no SSRF / private-network protection is implemented** — anything the browser can reach, this provider can fetch. The CDP endpoint is configured from the settings page with no loopback restriction, so only expose the settings page to trusted environments. Fetched pages are rendered locally; no data is sent anywhere beyond the target page itself — but note that in profile mode the requests (and any state changes a malicious page tricks the agent into) carry the remote browser's logged-in sessions (see the risk notes above).
