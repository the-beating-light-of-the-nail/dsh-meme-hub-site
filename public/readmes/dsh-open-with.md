# dsh-open-with

Open the current registered DeepSeek Harness Workspace in an installed local editor from the Web GUI. A compact split button in the Session Header launches the preferred editor directly or opens the complete editor chooser. The Workspace **…** menu remains available on compatible clients.

## Demo

[![Choose a local editor for a DeepSeek Harness Workspace](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChuanTianML/dsh-open-with/bfccd740dd86e02c77ee23193b9e8614af59416f/workspace-editor-chooser.gif?raw=true)](https://github.com/ChuanTianML/dsh-open-with/blob/open-with-assets/workspace-editor-chooser.gif)

The recording above shows the Workspace-menu entry retained for compatibility. In `0.2.0`, the same chooser is also available directly from the current Session Header.

## What it does

- The Session Header maps the current session through the Host-projected Workspace `sessionIds`; it never infers a Workspace from browser paths.
- The Host detects VS Code variants, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Trae, VSCodium, common JetBrains IDEs, Android Studio, Sublime Text, the platform terminal, and the platform file manager where a reliable launch route exists. Operator-configured profiles can add targets or override built-ins.
- The primary action opens the Workspace in the Host default or browser-remembered editor. Its chevron opens the available-editor menu; a selection launches that editor and becomes the browser's preferred choice.
- **Refresh editors** repeats Host discovery and atomically updates every mounted Header and Workspace-menu launcher without restarting DSH.
- Missing configured editors remain visible as disabled rows with a resolution hint. Missing automatic candidates stay out of the menu.
- The client uses `sidebar.workspaces.row-menu` when the Host declares it and otherwise installs a scoped compatibility adapter for client builds that do not yet expose that slot.
- Editor processes detach after launch and outlive the DSH Web server. Windows launches keep the application's first window visible, and child processes do not inherit API keys, tokens, passwords, or other credential environment variables from the Host.

## Supported launch targets

| Platform | Automatically detected targets |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | VS Code, VS Code Insiders, Cursor, Windsurf, Zed, Trae, VSCodium, IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, GoLand, CLion, Rider, PhpStorm, RubyMine, DataGrip, RustRover, Android Studio, Sublime Text, Terminal, Finder |
| Windows | The same editor applications, plus Windows Terminal and File Explorer |
| Linux | The same editor applications, plus `x-terminal-emulator` and `xdg-open` |

PATH lookup applies on every platform. macOS and Windows also probe the standard application locations encoded by each built-in profile. Windows additionally queries registered App Paths and the bounded JetBrains Toolbox apps directory. Detection runs when the Host plugin loads and whenever **Refresh editors** is selected. Configuration changes still require a DSH restart.

## Prerequisites

- At least one detected built-in or configured editor executable.
- DSH `0.1.0-rc.5` or newer. A newer runtime may provide the native Workspace row-menu slot; older compatible clients use the scoped adapter.

## Install

Add the plugin to the Web profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/ChuanTianML/dsh-open-with/archive/refs/tags/v0.2.1.tar.gz
```

Restart the Web server with `SIGTERM`, wait for it to exit, and refresh the page. Never use `kill -9`; it can interrupt a Session zstd write. Confirm the installed version with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web list dsh-open-with --depth 0
```

## Configuration

All deployment choices are validated Cordis configuration fields:

| Key | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autoDetect` | `true` | Add available platform built-ins. |
| `editors` | `[]` | Additional or overriding allowlisted `{ id, label, command, args }` profiles. |
| `defaultEditor` | `vscode` | Preferred id until this browser records a selection. |

Example:

```yaml
- id: dsh-open-with
  name: dsh-open-with
  config:
    defaultEditor: cursor
    editors:
      - id: fleet
        label: Fleet
        command: fleet
        args: []
```

Editor ids use lowercase letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens. Duplicate custom ids, empty labels, and invalid ids fail plugin load. A custom profile whose id matches a built-in replaces that built-in launch plan, which supports variants such as VS Code Insiders without exposing commands to the browser.

## Capability boundary

The browser receives only editor ids, labels, availability, and resolution hints. Commands and arguments never cross the wire. An open request carries only a Workspace id and an editor id; the Host resolves the Workspace through `ctx.workspaceRegistry` and the editor through its validated allowlist before spawning anything.

The editor process inherits desktop/session variables required to open graphical applications, but the Host removes environment variables whose names identify API keys, access tokens, secrets, credentials, passwords, private keys, connection strings, or database URLs. `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is retained because it identifies the user's agent socket rather than containing the credential itself.

The plugin opens only a currently registered Workspace whose directory still exists. It never reads, writes, clones, synchronizes, or uploads Workspace files. It registers no model tool, skill, prompt, or model-visible event. The launch needs no Agent approval because it follows an explicit user click in the Web UI.

The preferred editor is browser-local state. Different browsers can choose different defaults without changing Host configuration.

The preference changes only after the Host accepts a launch. Failures leave the prior choice intact and appear as a transient browser alert. On compatibility clients, keyboard navigation temporarily reveals the otherwise hover-only Workspace action buttons.

## Development

The repository expects a sibling DeepSeek Harness checkout at `../dsh` for linked development dependencies.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check
```

`pnpm run check` runs typecheck, lint, tests, and the production build. Commit `lib/` because file-profile installs do not build the package.

The strict Typert descriptors in `src/contract.ts` are shared by the Host manifest and client Remote contribution. The Host editor registry owns executable discovery and command privacy; the Workspace registry owns id-to-path resolution. The Harness owns the row-menu slot declaration, while the plugin keeps a narrow typed adapter until that declaration reaches the published client package.

See [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) for the interaction contract, security boundary, compatibility approach, and verification strategy.
