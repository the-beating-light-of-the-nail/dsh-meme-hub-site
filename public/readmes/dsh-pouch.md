## 📦 Plugins Included

| Plugin | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[`@moon16u/dsh-plugin-restart`](./packages/dsh-plugin-restart)** | Host / CLI | Safe, detached DSH process restart command (`/dsh-restart`) and agent tool (`dsh_restart`) with a 3-second grace period. |
| **[`@moon16u/dsh-plugin-current-time`](./packages/dsh-plugin-current-time)** | Host / Agent | Injects the host's real date, time, and timezone into agent context at the start of every turn, so a long-running session never reasons from a stale date. |
| **[`@moon16u/dsh-plugin-session-id`](./packages/dsh-plugin-session-id)** | Web UI | Displays a native-styled Session ID badge in the web session header with one-click clipboard copy. |
| **[`@moon16u/dsh-plugin-web-search-tavily`](./packages/dsh-plugin-web-search-tavily)** | Capability Seam | Real-time web search provider backed by the Tavily REST API, seamlessly integrating with DSH's `ctx.web` capability seam. |
| **[`@moon16u/dsh-plugin-llm-headers`](./packages/dsh-plugin-llm-headers)** | LLM Seam + Web UI | Provider routes whose request headers are yours to set from `settings.yaml` — including the `User-Agent` the harness reserves for itself: literals, `${env:NAME}` interpolation, per-model overrides, `null` deletion, plus a visual **Request Headers** settings page. Wire up any of pi-ai's 37 built-in providers with headers only. |
| **[`@moon16u/dsh-plugin-mcp-console`](./packages/dsh-plugin-mcp-console)** | Web UI + Host | MCP server console in the settings page: runtime add/edit/enable/disable/reconnect/delete, per-tool switches, live status over SSE, and mcpServers JSON import. Zero MCP protocol code — everything rides the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`. Profile-YAML MCP entries are auto-migrated into dynamic management on boot/refresh (and exportable back). |

## 🚀 Quick Start & Installation

### Method 1: One-Command Installation via DSH CLI (Recommended ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️)

Run a single command in your terminal. DSH will automatically download, bundle-register, and mount all 6 pocket plugins (zero manual configuration):

```bash
# 1. Install the entire toolkit via npm (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add @moon16u/dsh-pouch

# Or install directly from GitHub
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/moon16u/dsh-pouch.git
```

---

### Method 2: Local Git Clone Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moon16u/dsh-pouch.git ~/dsh-pouch
   ```

2. **Add the bundle to your DSH profile**:
   ```bash
   dsh plugin --profile web add file:~/dsh-pouch
   ```
   *DSH automatically detects `dsh.bundle` and applies the built-in `cordis.patch.yml` layer without manual configuration file edits.*

## 🛠️ Plugin Highlights

### 1. `@moon16u/dsh-plugin-restart`
* **Problem**: After editing plugins or configs, restarting DSH manually in an external terminal is tedious; killing the process directly inside an agent tool causes the session to freeze.
* **Solution**: Exposes `/dsh-restart` slash command and `dsh_restart` agent tool. Spawns an asynchronous detached worker process that returns the response immediately and restarts cleanly after 3 seconds.

### 2. `@moon16u/dsh-plugin-current-time`
* **Problem**: A model has no clock. It infers "today" from whatever the harness injected once at startup, so a session left open across midnight keeps reasoning from yesterday's date — and nothing in the transcript contradicts it.
* **Solution**: Hooks `agent/pre-step` and appends one wall-clock reading after the prompt on the first step of every turn. Once per turn rather than per step, so a tool-call loop does not bury the transcript in near-identical timestamps.

### 3. `@moon16u/dsh-plugin-session-id`
* **Problem**: Retrieving the current session UUID for debugging or log tracking requires digging into URLs or console logs.
* **Solution**: Injects a clean capsule button displaying the Session ID in the web header utility bar with instant one-click clipboard copying.

### 4. `@moon16u/dsh-plugin-web-search-tavily`
* **Problem**: Built-in search engines may be restricted or lack high-quality synthesized web answers.
* **Solution**: Formally implements the `ctx.web.registerSearchProvider` contract. Automatically resolves API keys from the `TAVILY_API_KEY` environment variable or DSH Credentials service.

### 5. `@moon16u/dsh-plugin-llm-headers`
* **Problem**: DSH merges its own attribution `User-Agent` into every provider request last, and a `headers` map written into `llm-pi-ai` cannot override that reserved name. Gateways that authenticate by client identity — Tencent CodeBuddy returns `500 {"code":11128,"msg":"request illegal"}` — are unreachable with configuration alone.
* **Solution**: Declare routes in your own `llm-headers` settings section, still served by the official `PiAiAdapter`; only the pi-ai provider is wrapped, so the configured headers get the final word before the socket. Ships with a **Request Headers** settings page (independent sidebar entry) — the stock provider cards expose no slot, and headers written into `llm-pi-ai` are stripped anyway. Wrapping the provider rather than the protocol object keeps pi-ai's own route implementations, so such routes wire up in a couple of lines. Routes without configured headers keep sending the DSH attribution unchanged, and deleting it is refused.

### 6. `@moon16u/dsh-plugin-mcp-console`
* **Problem**: The official way to attach MCP servers is a static `cordis.patch.yml` entry — no GUI, no runtime changes, and every restart to apply an edit. Declared servers show up as untouchable read-only instances.
* **Solution**: A full **MCP servers** settings section managing the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` at runtime: one fiber per server via cordis dynamic assembly (hot edit, no DSH restart), master switches, per-tool enable/disable pills, live status + tool lists over SSE, and mcpServers JSON import. External agents writing MCP entries into `cordis.patch.yml` are handled by an auto-ingest engine: on boot/refresh the entries are migrated into `~/.dsh/dsh-mcp.json` (fiber takeover included, YAML trimmed precisely), reversible via `POST /export-yaml`. Secrets stay masked in every API response.
