Claude Code is the first source adapter in a multi-tool migration layer. Claude2DSH preserves the useful conversation structure, writes through DSH's native persistence APIs, and keeps the original Claude directory read-only by default.

> [!NOTE]
> `0.2.0-rc.5` is a release candidate. The Awesome badge means the project is included in the curated [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin) list under **Sessions & Messages**. The automatic [awesome-dsh-plugins](https://github.com/AdamPlatin123/awesome-dsh-plugins) radar has not marked it as runtime-verified; the badge does not claim that verification.

## Why Claude2DSH

| Resume natively                                                                         | Bring more than chat                                                                                                                           | Return without risking the source                                                                                           |

| Claude turns become DSH-native session events that DSH can inspect, replay, and resume. | Skills, user-global instructions, project memory, tool-output sidecars, subagent transcripts, and plugin assets have explicit migration paths. | Export and sync target a safe copy under `$DSH_HOME` by default. Concurrent edits pause instead of overwriting either side. |

The governing principle is **zero-configuration by default**: the default path produces a visible result without requiring users to understand profiles or bundles first, while dangerous write-back remains explicitly gated.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Node.js `>=22.19.0`, pnpm, and the `dsh` CLI.

```sh
# Install the published plugin into DSH's built-in headed profile
dsh plugin --profile web add @claude2dsh/plugin@0.2.0-rc.5

# Start the browser UI; the terminal prints the local URL
dsh web
```

Then:

1. Open the URL printed by `dsh web`.
2. On a fresh DSH installation, choose **Configure later** if the model API-key prompt appears; migration itself does not call a model.
3. Open **Settings → Claude2DSH**.
4. Choose a language, confirm the Claude sessions directory, and optionally include subagent/workflow transcripts.
5. Click **Preview import**, inspect the counts and item report, then click **Run import**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    S1["Install plugin<br/>dsh plugin --profile web add ..."] --> S2["Start UI<br/>dsh web"]
    S2 --> S3["Open Settings → Claude2DSH"]
    S3 --> S4["Preview import"]
    S4 --> S5["Run import"]
    S5 --> R["Native DSH sessions<br/>listed in Session sources"]
```

The first section of **Settings → Claude2DSH** is the migration guide; Chinese is the default UI language and English is selectable. If port 3080 is already in use, run `dsh web --port 0` and open the URL printed by DSH.

Preview is read-only and returns an itemized plan before any DSH write.

This is what a successful run looks like. The screenshot comes from the real `0.2.0-rc.5` UI using a synthetic, privacy-safe Claude transcript.

### Repository helper

If you cloned this repository, the helper performs the same install into the main `web` profile and starts the UI on DSH's default local port (`3080`):

```sh
bash scripts/install-claude2dsh.sh
```

Set `CLAUDE2DSH_PROFILE` only when you intentionally want a custom profile. Headless profiles expose the same tools but do not include the browser UI.

| Export to Claude     | Continue a DSH session in Claude Code                                       | `claude2dsh_export`; writes a validated JSONL copy under `$DSH_HOME/claude2dsh/exports`                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Conflict merge       | Both sides grew after the watermark and neither version may be lost         | `claude2dsh_merge`; computes or creates a new merged copy rather than changing either original                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Tool-output sidecars | A transcript references large persisted tool results                        | `claude2dsh_sidecars`; lists or resolves copied files and records missing/oversize items                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Image policy         | Preserve transcript images while respecting the selected model's modalities | `imageMode: "auto"` follows the current DSH session route; leave the probe provider/model fields empty to follow the live session, or set them to override. The Settings page shows the current probe conclusion, and every import item records the degradation/upgrade reason. |
| Hook bridge          | Reuse the supported subset of Claude command hooks                          | **Settings → Claude hook bridge** scans Claude settings and plugin hooks read-only, previews mappable command hooks, and can save a candidate for the next boot; unsupported types are reported and skipped                                                                     |

Session import is idempotent: running it again reports an existing session instead of duplicating it. The default search is recursive and respects `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (falling back to `~/.claude/projects`), and the first-run guide displays the discovered source root and result counts. Project-level `CLAUDE.md` is not copied because DSH already reads it natively; only user-global context needs conversion.

## Settings tour

The Claude2DSH settings page keeps the first migration and safety-critical defaults in one place:

- **First-run migration** — language, source directory, optional subagents, preview, run, and itemized result.
- **Auto mirror** — opt-in watcher, debounce, and DSH-to-safe-copy direction.
- **Import defaults** — image mode/provider/model, subagent default, and sidecar size cap.
- **Export / write-back** — safe-copy target by default; original `~/.claude` write-back is a separate dangerous switch.
- **Claude hook bridge** — startup-only paths and activation guidance.
- **Session sources** — imported session ID, source kind, and source path.

The following real screenshots use the default Chinese UI and synthetic data; labels switch with the language selector.

## Safety model

- Import treats the Claude source as read-only. Preview performs no DSH write.
- DSH writes go through host persistence and the DSH-native roots under `$DSH_HOME/sessions`, `$DSH_HOME/skills`, and `$DSH_HOME/claude2dsh`.
- Export and sync default to `$DSH_HOME/claude2dsh/exports`; they do not write the original `~/.claude`.
- Writing the original Claude directory requires explicit `allowOriginalClaudeDir: true` authorization and remains refused by default.
- Plugin inventory reads assets without executing plugin code.
- Auto mirror pauses on concurrent growth. The explicit merge tool creates a new safe copy instead of guessing which side wins.

## Current limitations

- **Release-candidate status:** the public package is `0.2.0-rc.5`; interfaces and on-disk formats are not presented as a stable compatibility promise yet.
- **Hook bridge:** the upstream bridge supports **7 of Claude Code's 30 hook events**, only `type: "command"` handlers, and partial semantics per supported event. Full hook compatibility is a roadmap goal, not a current claim.
- **Vision acceptance:** the native image path is implemented, but it has not been accepted against a real vision-capable DSH model route. The shipped DeepSeek adapter declares text-only input.
- **Auto mirror:** it is opt-in and off by default. It writes DSH turns only to the safe Claude export copy; when both sides grow, it pauses and reports a conflict. Automatic merge is not implied.
- **Plugin compatibility:** inventory and selected assets can migrate, but arbitrary Claude plugin runtime behavior is not automatically portable to DSH.
- **Source adapters:** Claude Code is currently the only adapter. Codex and other tools remain roadmap work.
- **Session-list decoration:** DSH has no per-session sidebar-row extension point, so source identity is shown in Settings and through `claude2dsh_session_sources` instead.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>I installed the plugin but cannot see a UI.</strong></summary>

You probably used a headless profile. Install into the built-in `web` profile and start `dsh web`; the page is under **Settings → Claude2DSH**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Will it write my real ~/.claude?</strong></summary>

Not during migration. Export and sync also target a safe copy under `$DSH_HOME` by default. Original-directory write-back requires a separate explicit authorization.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are Auto mirror and the hook bridge off by default?</strong></summary>

Both can execute work after the first import. They stay opt-in so the user sees and accepts their scope first; the hook bridge is also limited to the documented 7/30 command-only subset.
