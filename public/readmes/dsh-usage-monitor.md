# dsh-usage-monitor

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Usage dashboard for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). It folds provider-reported token usage out of session logs and charts it in Settings.

![Settings → Usage: tiles, stacked chart, and provider cards](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NOirBRight/dsh-usage-monitor/bfa09817b781b5d4b9491762e7c9b007f20b3d36/docs/screenshots/settings-usage.png)

## What it shows

- Tokens, requests, output tokens, and cache-hit rate
- Stacked chart with Metric (token / request), By (provider / model / workspace), Group (day / week)
- Week, month, and custom ranges
- A responsive overview with a full-width token summary, compact secondary metrics, a stacked chart, and token-share cards that follow the current By grouping
- On narrow screens, the cards collapse to one column and the chart legend scrolls horizontally

Subscription quotas are not fetched.

## Installation

DeepSeek Harness 0.1.0-rc.6 or later is required. Install directly from GitHub:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:NOirBRight/dsh-usage-monitor#v0.2.9
dsh web
```

The repository tracks release-ready lib artifacts, so GitHub installation needs no build-script allowlist. A source checkout can use a link installation after running `pnpm run build`.

Then open **Settings → Usage**.

## Data

Reads `ctx.sessionQuery` (live + persisted sessions). Does not scan `session.jsonl.zstd` itself and does not read leftover community cache files.

## Release

`pnpm run check` runs the full gate in order: unit tests, TypeScript typecheck, deterministic build-parity (clean temp build vs tracked `lib/`), package build, and a real `npm pack` + immutable fixture validation + offline install + Host/client import smoke. The pack check reads only the repository-owned alpha.1 manifest/tarballs, verifies official tag/commit and registry integrity, preserves versioned parent edges including duplicate versions, and uses a fresh pnpm consumer with an invalid registry, offline/no-scripts/no-audit/no-fund settings, empty `NODE_PATH`, and scoped local-tarball overrides; it uses neither `--legacy-peer-deps` nor omit/force bypasses. The owner archive is written only below the prefixed temporary directory; repository .tgz files are limited to the 86 alpha.1 fixtures. It does not rewrite `lib/` before comparison, so a stale, missing or hand-edited artifact fails.

For a tag, run `pnpm run check:strict` (the same test, typecheck, parity, build, and pack order with `PARITY_CHECK_HEAD=1`; it fails if the committed `lib/` still differs from the source — the v0.2.5 drift guard). Keep `src` as the source of truth and commit the rebuilt `lib/`.

The Settings → Usage nav icon is a DOM patch via `ctx.effect` + `MutationObserver` on `document.body`; see `src/client/nav-icon.ts` for the `ctx.effect` disposer and the accepted alpha.1 DOM risk.


## Release installation (Latest)

Session-log usage dashboard with responsive metric cards, charting, and provider shares. The release artifact targets DeepSeek Harness 0.1.2-alpha.1 and contains built Host/Client files only; it has no sibling-repository source, workstation path, link:, or workspace: dependency.

Latest installation (the URL never contains a version):

~~~sh
dsh plugin --profile web add --force \
  https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-usage-monitor/releases/latest/download/dsh-usage-monitor.tgz
~~~

Fixed-version installation:

~~~sh
dsh plugin --profile web add --force \
  https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-usage-monitor/releases/download/v0.2.9/dsh-usage-monitor.tgz
~~~

Update, uninstall, and verify:

~~~sh
# Update to the latest Release
dsh plugin --profile web add --force \
  https://github.com/NOirBRight/dsh-usage-monitor/releases/latest/download/dsh-usage-monitor.tgz
# Verify the loaded version
dsh plugin --profile web list
dsh plugin --profile web doctor
# Uninstall only this plugin
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-usage-monitor
~~~

Configuration: use the plugin section in Settings for Web UI plugins, or the profile dsh.profile.bundles entry for Host-only plugins. Start with this README's minimal YAML/JSON example and provide credentials/backend addresses explicitly.

Rollback: rerun the fixed v0.2.9 command, verify the profile list, then restart the Web service once. Inspect journalctl --user -u dsh-web.service and dsh plugin --profile web doctor; never put a source checkout in the production profile.
