## Compatibility

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Harness | DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` |
| Node | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` (the DeepSeek Harness runtime) |
| Platforms | All (the skills are content; the provider is a host plugin) |
| Model | Any (skills load on demand via the `skill` tool; `plugin_vet` is deterministic) |

## What you get

`dsh-skill-pack-security` is a **skill pack + supply-chain gate** for DeepSeek Harness. It ships eight security methodologies as `SKILL.md` bundles that the model discovers in its session catalog and loads on demand with the `skill` tool, plus the automated `plugin_vet` pre-install scanner. **The skills teach the methodology; the plugin executes the static checks.**

- **Eight skills, two editions** — every skill ships with identical names and metadata in `skills/` (Chinese) and `skills-en/` (English); install one language per root.
- **`plugin_vet` gate** — a zero-dependency scanner (license / SBOM / commit pinning / malicious patterns / data-responsibility review / five-dimension risk card) registered by the optional `provider/` plugin on `ctx.tools`.
- **Findings cite the skills** — every finding points to the matching skill section (for example `supply-chain-review §1`) so the agent can continue the manual audit.
- **Executable by a model** — each skill step is a real command (`gitleaks`, `trivy`, `pnpm audit`, `npm view`, `git …`) with an expected-output sample and an exit-code criterion.

## Why skills, not tools?

| Shape | What it does | What it cannot do |
|---|---|---|
| Tool plugin (e.g. security scanners) | *Executes* scans, returns findings | Interpret alerts, tier false positives, write redacted reports |
| Protocol layer | *Constrains* a protocol | Generalize across repos and agents |
| **Skill pack (this repo)** | *Teaches methodology*: triage, reporting, remediation order — **and** automates the static pre-install checks via `plugin_vet` | Replace a manual audit end to end |

Installed together with a tool-type security plugin, the two compose: the tool runs the scan, the skill drives interpretation, triage, and the report. This pack combines both shapes: the skills teach the methodology, and `plugin_vet` runs the mechanical static subset automatically, with every finding pointing back into the skills.

The Claude Code ecosystem's 3000+ skills prove the distribution value of this shape. DSH's `SKILL.md` frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `whenToUse`) is format-compatible with CC skills; this pack uses only the common subset and its content is entirely original.

## The eight skills

| Skill | Purpose | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| `security-audit` | Five-phase audit flow: scope → inventory → risk tiering → verification → report template | Whole-repo audits, audit reports, planning |
| `secret-scan` | Credential audit: gitleaks/trivy usage, false-positive tiers, redacted reports, remediation order | Secret scanning, alert triage, leak reports |
| `dependency-audit` | Supply-chain audit: pnpm/npm audit reading, licenses, typosquat risk, lockfile drift | Dependency review, audit-report interpretation |
| `supply-chain-review` | Quick PR/new-dependency review: dangerous install scripts, typosquat, reproducible builds | Reviewing PRs that add dependencies |
| `prompt-injection-review` | Injection-surface review for agent projects: AGENTS.md, skills, tool descriptions, MCP, web | Reviewing model-context injection surfaces |
| `threat-model` | Design-stage threat modeling: trust boundaries, STRIDE table, attack trees, mitigations | Modeling new features, design-stage security review |
| `vuln-intel` | Vulnerability intelligence: NVD/CISA-KEV/GHSA/OSV lookups with verdict criteria | Given a CVE/GHSA id, checking impact and exploitation |
| `incident-response` | Agent-environment incident response: contain → evidence → recover → postmortem | Suspected security incidents in DSH/agent setups |

Each bundle keeps its main file ≤ 300 lines (progressive disclosure; details live in `references/`).

## plugin_vet — the automated pre-install gate

`plugin_vet` is the pack's automated complement: a zero-dependency scanner registered by the `provider/` plugin on `ctx.tools`. Point it at a GitHub `owner/repo` or a local package path — it downloads the tarball once (timeout + `AbortSignal` respected), scans within budget limits, and returns a render card.

- **License scan** — finds the LICENSE file and the `license` field; `NOASSERTION`/`UNKNOWN`/`SEE LICENSE IN <file>`, a missing file, or a missing field is flagged; common SPDX ids are recognized.
- **SBOM** — extracts the dependency tree with versions from the lockfile (pnpm/npm/yarn).
- **Commit locking** — install-manifest refs and workflow actions must be immutable 40-hex commit SHAs; `@tag`/branch refs are flagged as mutable.
- **Malicious patterns** — lifecycle scripts (`preinstall`/`install`/`postinstall`), network-exfiltration domains, and obfuscated/encoded payloads in shipped code.
- **Data-responsibility review** — the policy-scan dimensions as deterministic rules: ungated listeners on sensitive seams (`agent/pre-step`, `tools/pre-execute`, `session/event`, …), outbound endpoints without README telemetry/privacy disclosure, description-behavior keyword coverage, and embedded instruction-override payloads in shipped text (skills, docs, prompts, tests). Every finding cites `prompt-injection-review` for the manual deep-dive; disable per deployment with `vet.dataResponsibility: false`. A model-assisted review stage is the documented future upgrade.
- **Five-dimension risk report** — license / source / dependencies / build scripts / maintenance, each 0–100, folded into an overall verdict: PASS, WARN, or FAIL.

**Install gate.** The verdict feeds an installation gate — `gate.policy: warn` (default, non-blocking) prints a warning on FAIL; `gate.policy: deny` blocks the installation:

```yaml
- id: skill-pack-security
  name: '@perrylink/dsh-skill-pack-security-provider'
  config:
    language: en
    vet:
      gate:
        policy: deny   # block installs that fail plugin_vet
```

**Complementary to `dsh-plugin-check`.** The official plugin validator's 36 checks verify a plugin's *contract and quality* (config schema, effect registration, tool JSON shape); `plugin_vet` verifies the *supply chain* of where a plugin comes from. Run both:

| | `dsh-plugin-check` (36 checks) | `plugin_vet` (this repo) |
|---|---|---|
| Question answered | Is this plugin well-formed and contract-compliant? | Is this package safe to install? |
| Looks at | Plugin code, schema, registrations, tool contracts | LICENSE, lockfile, install refs/actions, lifecycle scripts, exfil/obfuscation, maintenance, data-responsibility (hooks scope, telemetry disclosure, description-behavior, embedded injection payloads) |
| Verdict | Pass/fail per check | PASS / WARN / FAIL + gate |
| When | Plugin development or review | Before `dsh plugin add`, PR review, CI supply-chain gate |
| Blocking | CI gate (non-zero on violations) | Configurable: `warn` (default) or `deny` |

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. install the bundle into your profile
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-skill-pack-security#main"

# or from npm (published releases)
dsh plugin --profile web add @perrylink/dsh-skill-pack-security-provider

# 2. restart and verify the row
dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep -A3 'id: skill-pack-security'
```

## Install & uninstall

- **git channel** (latest `main`): `dsh plugin --profile web add "github:PerryLink/dsh-skill-pack-security#main"` — mounts the provider bundle; `prepack` embeds both editions into the tarball.
- **npm channel** (published releases): `dsh plugin --profile web add @perrylink/dsh-skill-pack-security-provider`.
- **tarball channel**: `pnpm pack` in `provider/`, then `dsh plugin --profile web add ./@perrylink-dsh-skill-pack-security-provider-<version>.tgz`.
- **uninstall**: `dsh plugin --profile web remove @perrylink/dsh-skill-pack-security-provider` (or remove the row; pure-skill copies are removed with the installer's `-Uninstall` / `--uninstall`).

## Installing the skills by hand

DSH's local skill provider scans four roots by rank (lower rank wins same-name conflicts within a layer):

| Rank | Root | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| 100 | `<projectRoot>/.dsh/skills` | Project-scoped, travels with the repo |
| 200 | `<projectRoot>/.agents/skills` | Project-scoped, shared agent directory |
| 400 | `<dshHome>/skills` (`$DSH_HOME` or `~/.dsh`) | User-scoped, DSH-only |
| 500 | `<agentsHome>/skills` (`$DSH_AGENTS_HOME` or `~/.agents`) | User-scoped, cross-agent |

Ranks (lower wins same-name conflicts within a layer): `project-dsh 100 < project-agents 200 < custom 300 < user-dsh 400 < user-agents 500`. Custom rank 300 is plugin-registered (such as this pack's optional `provider/`), not a disk root.

```powershell
./scripts/install.ps1 -Target user-agents -Language zh   # Target: project-dsh | project-agents | user-dsh | user-agents; Language: zh (default) | en
```

```sh
bash ./scripts/install.sh --target user-agents --language en
```

## What's inside

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | The eight skills (Chinese edition); frontmatter follows the official `dsh-skill-filesystem` contract |
| `skills-en/<name>/SKILL.md` | The eight skills (English edition); same names and metadata as the Chinese edition |
| `skills/<name>/references/` | Progressive-disclosure detail: command matrices, triage tables, templates |
| `scripts/install.ps1` | One-command Windows installer for all four roots (both language editions); records a manifest, supports `-Uninstall`/`-DryRun`/`-Force` |
| `scripts/install.sh` | The POSIX equivalent (`--uninstall`/`--dry-run`/`--force`) |
| `provider/` | npm-installable provider bundle (declares `dsh.bundle`; embeds both editions in `pack/` via `prepack`; `language: zh\|en`); registers the skills provider AND the `plugin_vet` gate tool via `ctx.effect()`, fails loud on a bad `skillsDir` |
| `provider/src/vet/` | The zero-dependency `plugin_vet` scan engine (license / SBOM / commit lock / malicious patterns / risk report) |
| `package.json` | Root bundle manifest: declares `dsh.bundle.patch` (→ `provider/cordis.patch.yml`) and `dshWorkshop` intake facts |
| `verify/verify-skill-pack.mts` | Headless verification against the official parser, the real `skill` tool, and the real tools runtime — 25 checks across both editions |
| `VERSION` | Single version source; every SKILL.md `metadata.version` and `provider/package.json` must match it (CI-enforced) |
| `docs/` | Ecosystem conflict check, release checklist, improvement plans, and `plugin_vet` demos |
| `CHANGELOG.md` / `SECURITY.md` / `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Release history, vulnerability reporting policy, and contribution/verification rules |
| `.github/workflows/verify.yml` | CI: 25-check verification + installer exercise + provider build/pack smoke (Ubuntu and Windows) |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | Weekly dependency updates for the provider and GitHub Actions |
| `LICENSE` | Apache License 2.0 |
| `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` | Third-party posture: zero-dependency engine, evaluated-but-not-ported assets, peer dependency licenses |

## Configuration

All tunables are Schemastery `Config` fields (changeable from cordis.yml). `provider/cordis.patch.yml` documents each key inline.

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `language` | `zh` | Edition to publish: the Chinese `skills/` or the English `skills-en/`; ignored when `skillsDir` is set |
| `watch` | `false` | Watch the packaged skills directory (static content, so disabled) |
| `skillsDir` | *(unset)* | Explicit skills root; overrides the `language`-derived default and must hold `<skill>/SKILL.md` bundles |
| `vet.enable` | `true` | Register the `plugin_vet` gate tool |
| `vet.timeoutMs` | `15000` | Tarball-fetch timeout in ms |
| `vet.maxFiles` | `800` | Scan file cap |
| `vet.maxFileBytes` | `262144` | Per-file byte cap |
| `vet.maxExtractBytes` | `67108864` | Extraction byte cap |
| `vet.maxDepNodes` | `600` | Dependency-tree node cap |
| `vet.maxFindingsPerCheck` | `12` | Findings cap per check |
| `vet.userAgent` | `dsh-skill-pack-security/2.1.4 (+https://github.com/PerryLink/dsh-skill-pack-security)` | Fetch user-agent |
| `vet.gate.policy` | `warn` | Install gate: `warn` (non-blocking) or `deny` (block on FAIL) |

## Tools & surfaces

| Surface | Kind | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `plugin_vet` | tool | Pre-install supply-chain scan (license / SBOM / commit lock / malicious / risk card); findings cite skill sections |
| `skill-pack-security` | skill provider | Registers the pack's `skills/` or `skills-en/` edition on `ctx.skills` |
| Eight `SKILL.md` bundles | skills | The audit methodology, in two language editions |
| install gate | gate | `vet.gate.policy: warn \| deny` feeds installation decisions |

## Permissions & data

- **Permissions**: the `dshWorkshop` manifest declares `files:read` and `network:fetch`.
- **Data**: `plugin_vet` downloads a tarball once (timeout + `AbortSignal` respected) and reports redact secret-shaped text; the plugin injects no prompt sections.

## Security boundaries

- **Zero-dependency engine.** `plugin_vet` uses only `node:` builtins and relative imports.
- **Narrow pre-install gate.** Not a general-purpose security-audit tool — deliberately complementary to scanner plugins and the official `dsh-plugin-check` contract validator.
- **Non-blocking by default.** The install gate is `warn` unless you opt into `deny`.
- **Original content.** Format-compatible with Claude Code skills, but no copied CC skill content and no skill marketplace.
- **Original engine, no third-party ports.** The license scan and malicious-pattern checks are original zero-dependency implementations; the GPL-Radar / LLM-detective / Sus-PY assets were evaluated for porting but no licensed public source was found — see `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

## Verification

`verify/verify-skill-pack.mts` imports the **official** `dsh-skill-filesystem` parser, the **real** `skill` tool, and the **real** tools runtime from a local `deepseek-harness` checkout and asserts 25 checks over both language editions:

1. Layout: both editions present, 8 directory bundles each, no stray flat skills, frontmatter `name` matches directory, ≤ 300 lines, `references/` wired, `metadata.version` synced to the `VERSION` file
2. No name conflicts with the official `.agents/skills/` skills (derived from the checkout at run time) or known community skill packs
3–6. Per edition (Chinese `skills/`, English `skills-en/`): registry discovery through the official provider, full `ctx.skills.get()` loads, the real `skill` tool returning `<skill_content>` (unknown/invalid names rejected), and the session catalog containing `name` + `description` only — `whenToUse` stays out of the model catalog (official design)
7. 13 bad-frontmatter fixtures exercise the official fail-closed rules (missing fields, legacy camel-case keys, non-boolean values, non-kebab names, nested dirs, name mismatch); flat-file skills load and nested `**/SKILL.md` is not discovered
8. The optional provider plugin mounts the Chinese and the English edition via `ctx.effect()`, disposes cleanly, and rejects misconfiguration (empty or nonexistent `skillsDir`)
9–15. Self-hardening checks: zh↔en structural parity, references wiring (no dangling/orphan files), provider version sync, documented skill-root ranks vs the official constants, POSIX-portable `grep -E` patterns, secret self-check, UTF-8-safe release checklist
16–19. `plugin_vet` through the real tools runtime: it registers on `ctx.tools`; the compliant fixture passes; the no-license fixture fails and cites `dependency-audit §3`; the malicious postinstall fixture fails (scripts/exfil/obfuscation, citing `supply-chain-review §1`); the gate blocks installation under `policy: deny`
20. The scan engine is zero-dependency (`node:` builtins and relative imports only)
21. Report redaction keeps secret-shaped text out of rendered output

```powershell
# local: auto-resolves the harness checkout beside the pack, or point it explicitly
$env:DSH_HARNESS_CHECKOUT = 'D:\deepseek-harness'
& D:\deepseek-harness\node_modules\.bin\tsx.CMD verify\verify-skill-pack.mts
# All 25 checks passed for dsh-skill-pack-security.
```

The same 25 checks run on GitHub on every push via `.github/workflows/verify.yml` — on Ubuntu and Windows — plus an `install.sh`/`install.ps1` exercise and a standalone provider build/pack smoke that asserts the tarball carries both embedded editions and the bundle patch.

## Known limitations

- **Not a full audit tool.** `plugin_vet` is a narrow pre-install trust gate; it cannot replace a manual, end-to-end audit.
- **Static scan only.** The malicious-pattern and maintenance signals are heuristics over the shipped package, not dynamic analysis.
- **One edition per root.** Same-name skills in one root resolve by rank, so only one language edition enters a session catalog.

## Roadmap

- `dsh-skill-pack-data-engineering` — data pipelines, data quality, ETL checklists (same template)
- `dsh-skill-pack-oss-collab` — PR etiquette, issue triage, maintainer workflows
- `dsh-skill-pack-performance` — profiling methodology, benchmark criteria, regression checklists
- More skills inside this pack (same pure-skill boundary): `sbom-lifecycle` (SBOM generation/aging/import workflows), `pen-test-review` (authorized-engagement scoping and report review), `compliance-audit` (ASVS/NIST-CSF walkthroughs)
- Keep the `plugin_vet` demo artifacts fresh (`docs/demos/run-demos.mjs`) and the `dsh-plugin-check` complement table accurate as the official checker adds checks

## Development

```sh
pnpm --dir provider run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm --dir provider run build       # tsc --noEmitOnError
pnpm --dir provider run prepack     # embeds both skill editions into the tarball
tsx verify/verify-skill-pack.mts    # 25-check headless verification
```
