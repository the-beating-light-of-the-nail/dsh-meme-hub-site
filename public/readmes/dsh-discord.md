![dsh-discord — Discord-native DeepSeek Harness remote controller](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/suuuuuu-1/dsh-discord/0a2293d5526e17f28b540f33c9c75d481f27a5c9/assets/dsh-discord-cover.png)

Bidirectional Discord bridge and remote controller for DeepSeek Harness.

Listed in the independent community-run [DSH Marketplace](https://dshmarketplace.dev/plugins?q=dsh-discord) ([source](https://github.com/DshMarketPlace/dshmarketplace)).

The dedicated `discord` profile supports one owner and project across DMs, guild text channels, and threads. Each Discord conversation owns an independently persisted DSH Session. Owner DMs trigger directly; ordinary guild-channel messages require an explicit bot mention; an already-bound thread continues without repeated mentions. Slash commands never require a mention.

The bot invite requests View Channel, Send Messages, **Send Messages in Threads**, Read Message History, Embed Links, and Attach Files. `doctor` checks the same permission set. Discord server and channel permissions determine where the bot is visible; the plugin remains single-owner and fail-closed.

The controller includes natural text, `/dsh help/status/new/stop/steer`, coalesced progress, approvals, structured questions, image and text/code attachment ingress, durable event deduplication, Gateway reconnect, and managed daemon operation.

Enable **Message Content Intent** on the Discord Developer Portal Bot page for natural guild-channel messages.

```bash
# Until an npm release is available, install the CLI from GitHub.
npm install --global github:suuuuuu-1/dsh-discord
dsh-discord setup --package-spec github:suuuuuu-1/dsh-discord
dsh-discord doctor
dsh-discord start

# or managed background mode
dsh-discord start --daemon
dsh-discord status
dsh-discord stop
```

The global CLI is only a launcher. The plugin itself is activated in the dedicated `discord` profile and remains bound to the single project selected during setup; it does not become active in every directory or in the `web` profile.

The Bot Token is stored only through DSH Credentials. See [README.zh.md](README.zh.md), [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md), and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
