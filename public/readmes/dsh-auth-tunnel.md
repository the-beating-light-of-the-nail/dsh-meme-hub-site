# DSH Auth Tunnel

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

Expose the DeepSeek Harness Web GUI through a password-protected Cloudflare Tunnel without changing `deepseek-harness` itself.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- The `dsh` CLI and pnpm are available on `PATH`; the plugin command creates the Web profile when it is missing.
- `cloudflared` available on `PATH`, or an absolute `executable` configured for the plugin.
- A long, random shared password stored as a DSH credential.

### Install

Install the latest published prerelease bundle from npm:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-auth-tunnel@next
```

Or install the current sources from Git:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:ai-eks/dsh-auth-tunnel
```

This branch targets DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`. Harness `0.1.0-rc.8` and earlier must pin a compatible immutable tag or revision:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:ai-eks/dsh-auth-tunnel#v0.1.0-rc.8' # Harness rc.8
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:ai-eks/dsh-auth-tunnel#b4baea7c47f5c245da789d3553d41938df89b311' # Harness rc.7
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:ai-eks/dsh-auth-tunnel#v0.1.0-rc.6' # Harness rc.6
```

Git installs build the checked-out sources through `prepare`. pnpm 10 and later may first ask you to allow that build in the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; follow the path and exact package key printed by `dsh` and then rerun the command.

For a local checkout, build it before adding the path:

```sh
cd /path/to/dsh-auth-tunnel
pnpm install
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

The bundle inserts and enables the `auth-tunnel` row in quick mode and replaces the Host-native directory picker with the in-app browser picker. No `deepseek-harness` source edit or extra profile row is required.

### Quick mode

Quick mode is the default. Store the shared password in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml` (`$DSH_HOME` defaults to `~/.dsh`):

```yaml
DSH_WEB_PASSWORD: 'replace-with-a-long-random-password'
```

Start the Web profile:

```sh
dsh web
```

Starting before `DSH_WEB_PASSWORD` is configured no longer fails the Web profile. The plugin stays mounted with an error status and starts the tunnel automatically after that credential is added.

After the tunnel is ready, the terminal prints:

```text
cloudflare tunnel: https://<random>.trycloudflare.com
```

Open that URL and enter `DSH_WEB_PASSWORD` on the login page. Share the URL, not the password. The active row also appears in Web Settings → Plugins.

### Web settings

With the Loader `auth-tunnel` row enabled, open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Auth Tunnel** to edit every option. Saving the **Enable public tunnel** switch immediately starts or stops the gate and `cloudflared` while keeping this card available. The card also shows applying, running, stopped, or failed state and the current public URL.

**Allow remote pages to change settings** is enabled by default. The shared access password is an administrator credential: a signed-in public page can read and save the Auth Tunnel card and Language preference without local setup. Disable this switch if authenticated public pages should not manage the tunnel itself; enabling it again then requires a local page or the settings document. These writes use authenticated endpoints owned by this plugin, so they work with the unmodified DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2`. The switch is a separate fence from the core Host configuration plane: the gate proxies `settings.*`, `credentials.*`, and `llm.*` straight to the Host for every authenticated public page, except that core settings writes targeting the `auth-tunnel` namespace are rejected and must use the fenced plugin endpoint. The bundle's immediate client entry publishes that authenticated route before settings scopes classify the browser. The public GUI therefore keeps full configuration parity with the local one — responses come back redacted, and a secret crosses the wire only inside a write payload. Only one remote write is accepted at a time, and writes attempted while a previous change is applying return a conflict so the page can reload and retry. A remote page cannot save a change that would allocate a new random Quick URL (switching to Quick, or changing the Quick gate port or executable); make that change locally so the new URL remains discoverable. Turning the switch off remotely completes that save before access closes.

The card updates the credential named by the currently saved `passwordRef` through a separate **Update password** button. Password and configuration changes are never submitted as one transaction. The input clears after a successful update, and neither the Host nor the page returns or displays the literal. The password remains reusable until replaced and is not a login-once OTP. To change `passwordRef`, create that credential first and save the reference before updating its password. Store the Tunnel Token in the credential service first; `tokenRef` names that stored credential.

| Related setting | Quick | Token |
|---|---|---|
| Access password | Required and shared by both modes; updated separately through the write-only button | Required and shared by both modes; updated separately through the write-only button |
| Tunnel Token | Not used | Required; `tokenRef` names the stored Token |
| Public hostname | Not used; a temporary `trycloudflare.com` URL is assigned | Required; enter the hostname bound in Cloudflare |
| Gate port | Keep `0` for automatic allocation | Fixed `1–65535`, matching Cloudflare ingress |

Saved values apply automatically without restarting DeepSeek Harness. `passwordRef` and `sessionTtlHours` update in place; tunnel-level changes such as `mode`, `tokenRef`, `gatePort`, or `executable` start a candidate and then replace only the plugin's gate or `cloudflared`. If the candidate cannot start, the card reports the error and keeps the previous tunnel. A successful switch can briefly interrupt the public page; open the newly displayed URL and reload before retrying a failed operation. Switching back to Quick preserves the Token-mode fields for a later switch, and Quick ignores them. Keep the Loader row enabled for normal on/off control: setting Loader `disabled: true` unloads both the Host `auth-tunnel` settings namespace and its card.

### Named tunnel mode

Use token mode when the public hostname must remain stable. Create a named Cloudflare Tunnel, bind a hostname such as `gui.example.com`, and point its dashboard ingress at a fixed loopback gate such as `http://127.0.0.1:7677`.

Store both credentials in `$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml`:

```yaml
DSH_WEB_PASSWORD: 'replace-with-a-long-random-password'
DSH_TUNNEL_TOKEN: 'eyJhIjo...'
```

Override the bundle row in `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: auth-tunnel
  disabled: false
  config:
    enabled: true
    mode: token
    tokenRef: DSH_TUNNEL_TOKEN
    publicHostname: gui.example.com
    gatePort: 7677
```

`publicHostname` is only the DNS hostname: do not include `https://`, a port, or a path. Except for the Tunnel Token literal itself, the same configuration can be made and applied immediately through the Web settings card above. After changing `gatePort`, the Cloudflare Dashboard ingress must still point at the same port.

### Configuration reference

| Key | Type | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Whether the password gate and `cloudflared` run; saving `false` immediately stops public access while keeping settings available. |
| `allowRemoteSettings` | boolean | `true` | Whether authenticated public pages may update Auth Tunnel settings, its write-only access password, and the Language preference. |
| `passwordRef` | string (credential-ref) | `DSH_WEB_PASSWORD` | Credential reference resolving to the shared access password; when unconfigured, the plugin stays mounted and starts automatically after the credential is added. |
| `sessionTtlHours` | number ≥ 0.01 | `720` | Cookie lifetime in hours (30 days). |
| `mode` | `quick` \| `token` | `quick` | Ephemeral quick tunnel or named token tunnel. |
| `tokenRef` | string (credential-ref) | — | Tunnel Token reference; `token` mode only. |
| `publicHostname` | DNS hostname | — | Named-tunnel hostname without scheme, port, or path; `token` mode only. |
| `gatePort` | integer 0…65535 | `0` | Loopback gate port; `token` mode requires a fixed non-zero value. |
| `executable` | string | `cloudflared` | `cloudflared` PATH name or absolute path. |
| `startupTimeoutMs` | integer ≥ 1 | `15000` | How long activation waits for tunnel readiness. |

## Known limitations

- **Shared password, single-user administrator trust**: every password holder is treated as an administrator and receives the whole Web GUI, including the Auth Tunnel card, its write-only password input, and Language preference by default. Disabling `allowRemoteSettings` removes those plugin-owned controls, but does not restrict the core Host configuration plane (settings, credentials, LLM catalog), which is proxied to the Host for every authenticated public page. Responses are redacted and a secret travels only inside a write payload. There is no rate limiting, lockout, per-user session, or server-side revocation list. Do not share this password with less-trusted viewers; stronger deployments should use Cloudflare Access or another identity-aware proxy. Password rotation invalidates every session.
- **Single tunnel, no automatic restart**: an unexpected `cloudflared` exit is logged and shown in settings, but the tunnel does not restart automatically; toggle it off and on to recover.
- **Quick URLs change on every start**: use token mode and a domain when a stable URL is required.
- **Loopback remains unauthenticated**: the password protects the tunnel path only. Local browsers and processes can still reach the original Web GUI directly.
- **Minimal child environment**: the child inherits only `PATH`, `HOME`, and `TMPDIR`. A corporate proxy must be configured for `cloudflared` outside this plugin.
- **Loopback HTTP is plaintext**: the gate and upstream WebServer communicate over same-host loopback HTTP; TLS terminates at Cloudflare.
- **One directory-picker interaction per boot**: enabling the bundle uses the in-app browser picker for local clients too because the Web app cannot select native and browser pickers per connection.

## How it works

```text
public client
  → Cloudflare edge (TLS)
  → cloudflared (this host)
  → password gate, loopback only
  → existing loopback WebServer
```

### Password gate and proxy

The plugin requires the `webServer` and `credentials` services. It starts its own loopback `node:http` gate, resolves the configured password reference, and points `cloudflared` at that gate. The original WebServer and every route contributed by other plugins remain unchanged behind it.

Unauthenticated browser navigation is redirected to `/dsh-auth-tunnel/login`; other unauthenticated requests receive a small 401 response. A successful login mints the `HttpOnly; SameSite=Strict` `dsh_auth_tunnel` cookie, signed with an HMAC key derived from the password. Authenticated navigations also refresh a readable `dsh_auth_tunnel_surface=1` marker used only to classify the client before settings plugins activate; it grants no access, and the Gate still verifies the HttpOnly cookie on every request. The credential is resolved on every request, so rotating it immediately invalidates existing sessions. `GET` or `POST /dsh-auth-tunnel/logout` clears both cookies.

The gate caps login bodies at 16 KiB and proxies authenticated HTTP and WebSocket traffic. It rewrites `Host` and a matching browser `Origin` to the loopback upstream authority so the WebServer's DNS-rebinding and same-origin checks continue to see their trusted address. Foreign or opaque origins remain unchanged. HTTP hop-by-hop headers are removed on both proxy legs and regenerated per connection; upgrade handshakes retain their required fields. Client disconnects cancel the corresponding upstream request.

The only unauthenticated upstream application route is read-only `GET`/`HEAD /manifest.webmanifest`. Browsers fetch this metadata without credentials unless the page opts into credentialed manifest requests, and the file contains only public application metadata.

### Directory picker

The bundle disables the boot-selected native directory picker and mounts the in-app directory browser. A public `host.pickDirectory` request cannot operate an OS dialog on the Host display and otherwise waits until Cloudflare returns 524. The browser picker works for both local and public clients without per-route hooks.

### Tunnel lifecycle

- **quick** runs `cloudflared tunnel --url http://127.0.0.1:<gate>` and reads the generated `*.trycloudflare.com` URL from child output.
- **token** passes the Tunnel Token through `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in the child environment, runs `cloudflared tunnel run`, and waits for the registered-connection marker. The token never appears in argv.

Initial activation normally completes only after the gate is listening and the tunnel reports readiness. An unconfigured access-password credential is the recoverable exception: the plugin remains mounted with an error status and `running: false`, starts neither the gate nor `cloudflared`, publishes no public URL, and retries automatically when that credential is configured. When the access password is already available during initial activation, invalid mode fields or tunnel-token credentials, an occupied gate port, a missing executable, an early child exit, and readiness timeout all fail the initial plugin load before a public URL is announced. If one of those faults is first discovered by the asynchronous retry after an initially missing access password, the already-mounted plugin reports it through the settings error status instead. Runtime settings updates are coalesced and reconciled serially; rebuilds stage new resources before replacing old ones, and a failed replacement preserves the previous tunnel and reports through the settings status route. Disposal or the page switch closes the gate, sends `SIGTERM` to `cloudflared`, escalates to `SIGKILL` after 2000 ms when necessary, and removes the shell and prompt contributions.

## Model experience

Once the tunnel is ready, the plugin publishes `DSH_PUBLIC_URL` through the optional shell-env service and adds the `app:public-access` system-prompt section through the optional system-prompt service. Without this row, neither contribution exists.

The rendered prompt section is:

```markdown
This instance is also reachable from the public internet at <publicUrl> through a Cloudflare Tunnel, protected by the instance's shared access password. Share that URL — never the password — when the user asks to open this GUI from another device or network. All sessions, tools, and files still run on this host.
```

The section is static for the life of the tunnel process, so it does not invalidate the KV cache across turns.
