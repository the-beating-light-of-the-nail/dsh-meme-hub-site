**98 installable Agent Skills** for research, social intelligence, marketing, and business workflows. Install into any compatible agent (DeepSeek Harness, Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI) and start working immediately. The flagship research Skill works with host-provided search tools; connect SandBase when you want broader provider coverage.

SandBase also exposes [2,000+ models and APIs](https://www.sandbase.ai/docs/store/),
including a unified surface for [LLM, image, and video generation](https://blog.sandbase.ai/unified-ai-api-llm-image-video-2026/).
Skills define the workflow; the SandBase API or MCP bridge supplies optional model,
media, search, social, and data capabilities when a workflow needs them.

Start with `multi-source-search`: it runs with your agent's existing search tools,
ships a worked evidence-ledger example, and includes an offline validator. If it
improves a real workflow, [star the repository](https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-skills)
so other builders can discover it.

![Multi-source search workflow: search capabilities, source-origin tracing, evidence ledger, and offline validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-skills/84660c4a41de55dced84047a89d27913f0da7314/assets/multi-source-search-workflow.svg)

## What are Skills?

A Skill is an instruction file that teaches an AI agent how to do one specific job. Each Skill defines a repeatable workflow, evidence rules, and output format. Portable Skills can use capabilities already provided by the host agent; specialized social, market, and data workflows can add SandBase providers when configured.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Try it without installing: generate the complete Skill prompt
npx skills use sandbaseai/sandbase-skills@multi-source-search

# Or install it into Codex
npx skills add sandbaseai/sandbase-skills@multi-source-search --agent codex

# Use it with your agent's existing web/search tools
# "Fact-check this claim with independent sources and validate the evidence ledger"
```

`multi-source-search` needs no SandBase account when the host agent already provides
search and page-reading tools. For specialized social, market, and data-provider Skills,
set `SANDBASE_API_KEY` in your environment—never in a prompt or committed file.

### GitHub CLI (official Agent Skills workflow)

GitHub CLI 2.90.0 or later can preview a Skill before installing it. Because this
repository groups Skills by domain, pass the exact path shown in the catalog:

```bash
# Inspect the instructions and bundled files without installing anything
gh skill preview sandbaseai/sandbase-skills research/multi-source-search

# Install it for Codex at user scope
gh skill install sandbaseai/sandbase-skills research/multi-source-search \
  --agent codex --scope user
```

Replace the final path with another linked Skill path from the catalog below. See
GitHub's [`gh skill` documentation](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_skill) for
supported agents, version pinning, updates, and security guidance.

### Portable Agent Plugin (Copilot CLI and compatible clients)

Install the curated, account-free research plugin directly from this repository:

```bash
copilot plugin install sandbaseai/sandbase-skills:agent-plugin
```

The plugin follows the vendor-neutral [Agent Plugins 1.0 specification](https://agent-plugins.org/)
and currently packages `multi-source-search` with its references and offline evidence-ledger
validator. Its generated Skill copy is checked against the canonical source in CI.

### Add SandBase MCP tools to the same agent

Skills provide repeatable instructions; [SandBase CLI](https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli)
adds six MCP tools for discovering and running 2,000+ models and APIs. Connect one of
the 25 supported client targets, then use these Skills and MCP tools in the same agent:

```bash
npx -y https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli/releases/download/v0.1.17/sandbaseai-cli-0.1.17.tgz connect --client codex
```

Replace `codex` with another client ID from the
[verified catalog](https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli/blob/main/llms-install.md).
If the bridge is useful in your workflow, [star SandBase CLI](https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli/stargazers)
so other agent users can discover it.

### DeepSeek Harness

Install all 98 Skills as a native DSH bundle:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:sandbaseai/sandbase-skills
dsh web
```

The bundle mounts the packaged `marketing/` and `research/` directories through
DSH's filesystem Skill provider while preserving the default Skill roots.

To copy only the flagship Skill into one project's
`.dsh/skills/multi-source-search` directory:

```bash
npx --yes github:sandbaseai/sandbase-skills add multi-source-search
```

The single-Skill installer and the bundle both run directly from the GitHub source,
so no npm publication or SandBase account is required.

### Claude Code marketplace

Install all 98 Skills as a native Claude Code plugin:

```text
/plugin marketplace add sandbaseai/sandbase-skills
/plugin install sandbase-skills@sandbase-agent-skills
```

The marketplace manifest lists every Skill explicitly, so Claude Code can discover
them on demand without copying directories by hand.

### Verify research output offline

The [`multi-source-search`](research/multi-source-search/SKILL.md) Skill produces an
evidence ledger that can be checked before you trust or share its synthesis:

See the [complete worked example](examples/branch-protection-research.md), which
cross-checks one claim against primary documentation from GitHub, GitLab, and Atlassian.

```bash
python3 research/multi-source-search/scripts/validate_report.py \
  examples/verifiable-research-report.json
# VALID: 3 source(s), 1 claim(s), 2 provider(s)
```

The validator rejects unknown or duplicate sources, inflated confidence, unused
evidence, and high-confidence claims that still have a declared conflict. It runs
offline and checks internal consistency; it does not claim that a source is true.

For an end-to-end example that runs this research contract inside a governed,
sandboxed runtime, read
[Build an Auditable Research Agent](https://blog.sandbase.ai/auditable-research-agent-evidence-ledger-sandbox-replay/).

## Install

```bash
# Install any Skill by name
npx skills add sandbaseai/sandbase-skills@<skill-name> --agent codex

# Global install (available across all projects)
npx skills add sandbaseai/sandbase-skills@<skill-name> --agent codex --global

# Find indexed SandBase Skills by topic
npx skills find "research" --owner sandbaseai

# Browse every Skill in the repository
npx skills add sandbaseai/sandbase-skills --list
```

## Supported Agents

Skills work with any agent that implements the Agent Skills specification:

- **Claude Code** — `~/.claude/skills/`
- **OpenAI Codex** — `~/.codex/skills/`
- **Cursor** — `~/.cursor/skills/`
- **Gemini CLI** — `~/.gemini/skills/`
- **OpenClaw, Hermes, Amp, Devin** — via `npx skills add`

## How It Works

```
User Question → Agent reads SKILL.md → Uses host tools and/or SandBase → Validates evidence → Answer
```

1. You ask a question or give a task
2. Your agent reads the installed Skill's instructions
3. The Skill starts with compatible search or browser tools already available to the host
4. When configured, SandBase adds provider-specific capabilities via `sandbase_describe_tool` → `sandbase_call_tool`
5. The agent executes the workflow, validates structured evidence, and delivers the result

## SandBase Ecosystem

- [SandBase CLI](https://github.com/sandbaseai/cli) — connect Codex, Claude Code,
  Cursor, Gemini CLI, and other MCP clients to 2,000+ AI models and APIs with one
  onboarding command.
- [SandBase Harness](https://github.com/sandbaseai/sandbase-harness) — run
  persistent agent sessions with sandboxed tools, resumable streams, artifacts,
  cancellation, audit, and replay in your own infrastructure.
- [DSH Plugin Store](https://github.com/sandbaseai/dsh-plugin-store) — discover
  runtime-verified DeepSeek Harness plugins, install them into a local Web
  profile, and inspect active loader state from Settings.

## Pricing

Skills themselves are free and open source (Apache-2.0). `multi-source-search`
can use compatible host-provided tools without a SandBase account. Optional SandBase
API calls are usage-based — typically $0.001–$0.01 per call. A typical research task
using those calls costs $0.05–$0.20.

See [sandbase.ai/pricing](https://sandbase.ai/pricing) for current rates.
