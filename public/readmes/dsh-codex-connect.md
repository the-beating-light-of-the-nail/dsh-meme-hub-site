# Codex Connect

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dsh-codex-connect/alpha?label=npm%20alpha&color=cb3837)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-codex-connect)

English | [中文](docs/README.zh.md)

Connect your ChatGPT subscription to DeepSeek Harness with OAuth, optional GPT Image generation, user-controlled defaults, Harness-native approvals, diagnostics, and reliable session recovery.

Community Alpha — not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI, ChatGPT, Codex, DeepSeek, or DeepSeek Harness.

Codex Connect adds the `openai-codex` model provider to the normal Harness agent loop. Harness continues to manage tools, permissions, approvals, attachments, session persistence, compaction, and recovery. Installing the plugin does not change your default model or search route, and it does not turn a ChatGPT subscription into an OpenAI Platform API key.

## Quick start

This guide describes the published pairing below. Check `dsh --version` first; for another DSH version, use [Installation and upgrades](INSTALL.md). A moving npm tag such as `alpha` is not a compatibility guarantee.

| Requirement | Verified pairing |
|---|---|
| Codex Connect | `0.1.0-alpha.4.30` |
| DeepSeek Harness | `0.1.2-rc.1` |
| Node.js | `^22.19.0 \|\| >=24.0.0` |
| Account | ChatGPT OAuth with access to the requested Codex model; availability is decided by OpenAI |

### 1. Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-connect@0.1.0-alpha.4.30
dsh web
```

Replace `web` with your existing profile name; use that same profile when starting Harness. From a DSH source checkout, prefix commands with `pnpm`. See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for other profiles and installation checks.

### 2. Authorize and select a model

Open **Settings → Models → Openai-Codex → Authorize**, then complete approval yourself in the browser. If an embedded window is blocked, select **Open ChatGPT sign-in page**. Choose an `openai-codex` model in the normal Harness model picker.

Never paste an authorization URL, code, token, or account identifier into an issue, log, chat, or configuration file. For a browser on another device, follow [Remote browser authorization](docs/reference.md#remote-browser-authorization).

### 3. Check the installation

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect status --json
dsh plugin --profile web exec dsh-codex-connect doctor --json
```

`status --json` exits `0` when signed in and `1` when signed out, without starting OAuth. `doctor --json` reports local installation diagnostics without a network request or raw credentials. A passing diagnostic is not proof of model access; verify that with an actual request.

## Core capabilities

- **Accounts:** save up to 16 accounts on the DSH host and manually select the active account for subsequent requests. Account selection is not a per-session binding. Requests keep their captured account; the plugin does not rotate accounts or silently fail over.
- **Models and Astra support:** the currently verified DSH and plugin combination supports `gpt-6-astra`. The plugin supplies the Astra model definition missing from the current dependency catalog, so users can select it without separately upgrading the underlying library. When the installed dependency catalog includes Astra, the plugin prefers its native definition. A model appearing in the list does not mean the current account has permission to use it; overall compatibility with new dependency versions still requires separate verification.
- **Fast Mode:** request priority service for one conversation, off by default. Actual speed and quota consumption depend on the service; no fixed speed multiplier is guaranteed.
- **Quota:** show the server-returned `5h` and `7d` windows and reset times, normally refreshed every 60 seconds while signed in. Missing windows are not invented; Spark uses its separate quota bucket.
- **Update guidance:** compare the installed DSH/plugin pair with the public verification record without installing an upgrade.

## Optional capabilities

All options below are off on a fresh installation. Edit them in **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Codex Connect** or **Settings → Models → Openai-Codex → More settings**, then select **Save changes**. A conflict or failed save preserves your draft.

| Capability | Enable with | Important behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Proxy | `enableProxy` | Credential-free HTTP(S), scoped to this plugin's traffic. A failed proxy request does not silently retry directly. |
| Codex Search | `enableSearch` | Selects Codex for the entire profile's search route; disabling restores the previously active route. |
| Image viewing | `enableImageTool` | Adds `view_image` to vision-capable models for local files and validated public HTTP(S) images. |
| GPT Image generation | `enableImageGeneration` | Prompt-only generation; availability, dimensions, and quota remain account- and service-controlled. |
| Auto-review | `enableAutoReview` | Sends bounded approval context, tool arguments, working directory, and the planned action to `chatgpt.com`, with confirmation on first enablement. Failures return to human approval. |

Use the image generation capability included with your current GPT subscription. Generated originals are stored separately from attachment previews; disabling the capability or uninstalling the plugin does not delete them. See [Configuration and recovery](docs/reference.md#search-and-image-tools) for storage and access rules.

Auto-review operates after Harness policy requires approval; it does not bypass that policy. See [Auto-review behavior](docs/auto-review.md) before enabling it.

## FAQ and important limits

### Where are my credentials stored?

OAuth credentials are stored on the host running DSH and used there to authenticate and send requests to OpenAI. Normal browser account responses return account summaries, not raw tokens. A remote browser device is not necessarily the DSH host.

### Does uninstalling sign me out?

No. OAuth state is stored separately at `$DSH_HOME/.openai-codex-auth.json` (`~/.dsh` by default). The plugin does not copy or modify `~/.codex/auth.json`. Use **Sign out all accounts**, or `logout` before uninstalling, only when deleting credentials is intentional.

### Can I switch accounts for different conversations?

Subsequent Codex requests use the selected active account; conversations do not bind their own accounts. Fast Mode is conversation-scoped. Cancelling a new authorization preserves existing accounts; an explicit revoked-refresh response asks for reauthorization, while temporary failures preserve the account for retry. See [Account behavior](docs/reference.md#accounts-models-and-quota).

### Why does a listed model fail?

Account permissions, plugin/host compatibility, and network conditions all affect availability. Access on another client does not guarantee this integration will work. OpenAI controls model access, quota, context capacity, and service behavior; catalog entries are not proof of entitlement.

### Can I keep the original `dsh-codex` plugin installed?

Not in the same effective configuration: both register `openai-codex`. Follow [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md); remove only the confirmed conflicting entry, not credentials or unrelated providers.

### What do diagnostics prove?

`doctor` is local. Capability and reviewer probes may make network requests and consume quota when their preconditions are met. `auto-review-probe` checks only the reviewer route and structured response, not the full Harness approval integration or execution of the reviewed action. Commands, limits, and exit codes are in the [diagnostics reference](docs/reference.md#capability-probes).

A missing entry in [verified-compatibility.json](verified-compatibility.json) means a DSH/plugin combination is unverified, not known to be broken. Do not infer support for newer hosts from an older pairing.

```sh

pnpm run check
pnpm run test:browser
pnpm run check:dsh-install
```

`check` covers static checks, unit tests, build, compatibility, and packaging. `lint:metadata` checks package and release rules; `lint:source` checks host and browser TypeScript for unhandled or misused promises, invalid awaits, duplicate cases, and unreachable code. Browser regression and isolated DSH installation are separate commands. These checks use no real OAuth authorization and do not replace real-account acceptance.
