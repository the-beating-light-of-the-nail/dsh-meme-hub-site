# dsh-ui-liteglass

**LiteGlass** — English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A lightweight appearance skin for DeepSeek Harness.

**Wallpaper. Glass. Accent. That's it.**

## Features

1. **Custom Wallpaper**
   - Remote image URL, or upload a local image
   - Adjustable background opacity and background blur

2. **Glass-like Panels**
   - Adjustable panel transparency for a lightweight glass-like look

3. **Accent Color**
   - Customize the accent color used across supported DSH interface states
   - Adapts automatically to DSH's native Light / Dark appearance

## What makes it different

- **Server-side persistence, multi-device.** Settings and uploaded wallpaper are
  stored on the DSH host (not in the browser), so every device that reaches the
  host shares the same look.
- **Does not take over the native color mode.** Light / Dark / System stays fully
  owned by DSH native settings; the plugin only enhances appearance on top.
- **No second theme system.** Built on the official `theme.overrideTokens` seam
  and the DSH token system — no bundled CSS framework, no competing theme model.
- **Small, focused, predictable.** Wallpaper + glass + accent, nothing else.

## Identity

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| package | `dsh-ui-liteglass` |
| display name | **LiteGlass** |
| plugin id (client module / settings.section / theme source) | `dsh-ui-liteglass` |
| rowId / wiring.id (loader entry / skin-market) | `ui-liteglass` |

`rowId` matches the loader entry id in `cordis.patch.yml`, which is what skin
markets use for mutual-exclusion wiring. See `docs/IDENTITY.md` for the canonical
record.

## Compatibility

- **Supported:** the DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc` line (the current release-candidate
  series). The plugin uses only stable official seams (`webServer`, `settings`,
  `theme.overrideTokens`, `dsh.client` inject).
- **Tested with:** DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.7` (development runtime; client theme
  bundle `0.1.0-rc.8`).

DeepSeek Harness is still evolving quickly, so a future release may change plugin
interfaces; the supported range above is a declaration, not a promise of
forward-compatibility.

## Installation

From npm (once published):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-ui-liteglass
```

Or directly from the GitHub repository (works today):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/mumuer1024/dsh-ui-liteglass.git
dsh --profile web
```

To pin a specific release, add the tag:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'git+https://github.com/mumuer1024/dsh-ui-liteglass.git#v0.1.0'
```

`dsh plugin add` initializes the profile on first use and wires the bundle
automatically. After that, start the Web UI and open **Settings → Appearance**.

## Configuration

Open **Settings → Appearance** (the plugin adds its own section there):

- **Background**: Off / URL / local upload; background opacity; background blur.
- **Panel transparency**: how translucent the main surfaces are.
- **Accent color**: pick a color, or reset to the native value.

Changes are saved to the server and shared across devices that reach the DSH host.

## Uninstallation

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-ui-liteglass
```

Removing the plugin restores the original appearance. Note that uploaded
wallpaper files and the plugin config under `$DSH_HOME/ui-liteglass/` are not
removed by the uninstall command — delete that directory manually if you want
them gone.

## Known Limitations

- **Panel blur (`backdrop-filter`) is currently not enabled.** Applying a
  backdrop blur to the main panel containers breaks Settings / overlay
  positioning in the current build, so that effect is disabled. Background blur
  and panel transparency are functional and are not affected.
- The color mode (Light / Dark / System) is always controlled by DSH native
  settings — this plugin does not provide a color-mode switch.

## Development / Testing

Automated Node test suites cover the host routes, the client state model, and the
no-color-mode guarantee:

```sh
node test/host-smoke.mjs && node test/lifecycle.mjs && node test/no-appearance.mjs
```

`npm publish` runs the same suites via `prepublishOnly`. See
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for design details.
