# dsh-odoo

English | [繁體中文](README.zh-TW.md) | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](README.ja.md)

`dsh-odoo` is a free, open-source, read-only DeepSeek Harness plugin for the Odoo external API.
It lets an agent inspect Odoo business data — contacts, quotations, sales orders, invoices,
project tasks, leads, stock — without changing Odoo state. One opt-in tool can create a
strictly limited draft record, and it is not even registered unless you enable it.

> ✅ **Verified against Odoo 18 on 2026-08-27** — the official `odoo:18` image reporting
> `server_version` `18.0-20260817`. Most compatibility assumptions were checked on a live
> server; the results, and what is **still unverified**, are in
> [`docs/live-verification.md`](docs/live-verification.md): only Odoo 18 was tested (8–17 and 19
> were not), and only a Docker image reached directly — behind a reverse proxy, Odoo Online and
> Odoo.sh remain untested. The plugin speaks JSON-RPC only and needs `/jsonrpc` to be reachable
> (see [Transport](#transport)). When something breaks, please report the Odoo version and
> serie, how it is deployed (Odoo Online, Odoo.sh, self-hosted, container, and which reverse
> proxy sits in front), and the full output of `odoo_server_info`.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `odoo_server_info` | Read the server version and the authenticated user id. |
| `odoo_describe_model` | List the queryable fields of one allow-listed model. |
| `odoo_search_read` | Run a restricted `search_read` on one allow-listed model. |
| `odoo_create_draft` | Create one draft record. **Requires `allowWrite: true`**; otherwise it is never registered. |

## Transport

This plugin speaks **JSON-RPC 2.0** to `POST {baseUrl}/jsonrpc`, so your Odoo server must expose
that endpoint (it is provided by the `web` module). If the endpoint is missing, redirected, or
intercepted by a proxy, every tool fails with a `TRANSPORT_UNSUPPORTED` error that says so.
XML-RPC is not implemented.

## Model availability

The 14 allow-listed models are **not guaranteed to exist on every Odoo**. Only the `base` models
are always present; the rest come from business modules a stock Odoo does not install.

| Module | Allow-listed models | Installed by default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base` | `res.partner`, `res.users`, `res.company` | yes |
| `product` | `product.product`, `product.template` | no |
| `sale` / `sale_management` | `sale.order`, `sale.order.line` | no |
| `purchase` | `purchase.order` | no |
| `account` | `account.move`, `account.move.line` | no |
| `project` | `project.project`, `project.task` | no |
| `crm` | `crm.lead` | no |
| `stock` | `stock.quant` | no |

On a stock Odoo 18 with no business modules, querying `sale.order` fails with
`ODOO_VALIDATION_ERROR` carrying the upstream reason `Object sale.order doesn't exist`. Call
`odoo_describe_model` first to confirm a model is available on your instance.

## Requirements

- DeepSeek Harness with compatible `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tools` APIs
- Node.js 22.19 or newer in the 22.x line, or Node.js 24 or newer
- Bun 1.3.5 or newer when installing from GitHub source or developing locally
- An Odoo URL, database name, login, and API key (or password) with access to the models you query

## Configuration

Environment variables are recommended so credentials do not appear in a profile patch:

```sh
export ODOO_URL='https://odoo.example.com'
export ODOO_DB='production'
export ODOO_USERNAME='integration@example.com'
export ODOO_API_KEY='your-api-key'
```

Plugin config takes precedence over environment variables:

| Config | Environment fallback | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `baseUrl` | `ODOO_URL` | required |
| `db` | `ODOO_DB` | required |
| `username` | `ODOO_USERNAME` | required |
| `apiKey` | `ODOO_API_KEY` | required |
| `companyId` | `ODOO_COMPANY_ID` | unset |
| `allowWrite` | none (deliberately) | `false` |
| `locale` | none | `en` (`en` / `zh-TW` / `zh-CN` / `ja`) |
| `defaultLimit` | none | `20` (1–100) |
| `requestTimeoutMs` | none | `30000` (1–300000) |
| `maxResponseBytes` | none | `1000000` (1–52428800) |

Credentials are only required when a tool actually runs: installing the plugin without filling
them in does not break profile loading. `locale` switches tool and parameter descriptions;
tool names and error messages always stay in English.

## Safety

- **Read-only by default.** No `write`, `unlink`, or workflow actions exist in this release.
- **Model allow list.** Queries are limited to 14 standard models: `res.partner`, `res.users`,
  `res.company`, `product.product`, `product.template`, `sale.order`, `sale.order.line`,
  `purchase.order`, `account.move`, `account.move.line`, `project.project`, `project.task`,
  `crm.lead`, `stock.quant`.
- **No relational traversal.** Domain field names may not contain dots. To filter by a related
  record, query the related model first and then filter with `('partner_id','in',[ids])`. This
  keeps the allow list an actual capability boundary instead of a suggestion.
- **No binary fields.** Fields whose Odoo type is `binary` are rejected, and default field sets
  never include one.
- **Bounded responses.** Default fields per model, `limit` ≤ 100, `offset + limit` ≤ 10000,
  single string values truncated at 2000 characters, and a hard byte cap on every response.
- **Only non-archived records** are returned; the `active_test` context is not exposed.
- **Draft creation is opt-in and fixed.** `sale.order` is always created with `state=draft`;
  `project.task` may not specify `state` or `stage_id`, so Odoo applies its own default stage.
  Only an allow-listed subset of fields is accepted, and one-to-many commands are rejected.

## Non-goals for 0.1

- No business wrapper tools (`list_customers`, `list_quotations`, …). They depend on field
  assumptions that cannot be verified without a live Odoo, and a wrong assumption returns an
  empty result instead of an error — the worst failure mode for an agent. Deferred to 0.2.
- No updates, deletions, or workflow transitions; no attachments or report generation.
- No XML-RPC transport, no model discovery, no multi-database switching, no cursor pagination.

## Development

```sh
bun install
bun run lint
bun run typecheck
bun run test
bun run build
```

`scripts/smoke-odoo.sh` runs a manual end-to-end check against a real server; it is deliberately
excluded from CI.
