A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) Web plugin that visualizes agent file changes: inline **+N −M** badges on mutation tool rows, a per-turn file-change summary card, and full aligned diffs on click. Covers native `edit`/`write` calls, the minimal preset's `str_replace_editor`, and Code Dispatch (PTC) sub-calls end to end. No git dependency, no third-party plugin dependencies.

## Features

- **Five releases, one build** — the same bundle serves harness `0.1.1-rc.2`, `0.1.2-alpha.1`, `0.1.2-alpha.2`, `0.1.2-alpha.3` and `0.1.2-alpha.4` (the alpha line's client-runtime package, view envelope and service names changed since rc.2, while alpha.1 → alpha.4 left every surface this plugin touches untouched); diff hunks are read from the tools' persisted wire `meta` on all five
- **Inline +N −M badges** — takes over the stock mutation rows for `edit`, `write` and `str_replace_editor` (keyed lower-priority shadow; uninstall restores stock). Counts are the real changed lines — the same LCS walk the diff renders — estimated from the arguments while running, exact once the result settles
- **Aligned diff window** — expanding a row opens a height-capped scrollable unified view. Both sides are LCS-aligned first: shared lines render as up to ±3 lines of context around each change, untouched runs collapse into ⋯, and the footer counts exactly the rendered rows
- **Line-number gutters** — the file view numbers its lines 1..N and the diff window pins each hunk to its real position in the current file (one cached fenced read, uniqueness-checked): deleted rows read the old side, context/added rows the new side, with the changed rows' accent bars. A hunk that cannot be located (host absent, drifted file, over budget) numbers window-relatively 1..N, so the gutter always renders
- **Per-turn summary card** — a collapsible "N files changed +X −Y" bar at each turn's tail; per-file rows with type icons, directory, ±lines, review, open ▾ and undo. Same-file edits merge and accumulate in settlement order
- **Code Dispatch (PTC), end to end** — dispatch sub-calls carry no wire diff view: rows fall back to the argument-derived diff, and the summary card joins their files from the stock chat tool tree, so a pure Code-Mode turn still gets its card. `subCallId` dedup keeps replays from double-counting
- **File-context boost** — bare argument fragments gain up to ±3 lines of real file context when expanded: the booster reads the file through the host's fenced API, locates the fragment's post-image and rebuilds the hunk (best-effort; unlocatable fragments keep their bare form)
- **Undo** — reverts the turn's files to their pre-turn state: reverse uniqueness-checked hunk peeling, turn-start snapshots prove a file was CREATED (not overwritten) before its deletion, drifted files rejected before any write, atomic commits
- **Inline view & open-with** — "open" expands a height-capped file preview below the row; the ▾ menu keeps system open, Explorer reveal, VS Code, and absolute/relative path copy
- **Frosted glass (optional)** — with [deepseek-harness-background](https://github.com/HaoyueQin/deepseek-harness-background) installed, every plugin surface joins its shared glass recipe; without it the stock opaque look stays untouched — graceful degradation, zero third-party runtime additions (peer modules come from the harness)
- **zh / en** — copy follows the Web UI language (locale service)

## How it works

- **Badges & diffs**: registers the `edit`/`write`/`str_replace_editor` keys of the `tool.call.toolview` keyed slot at priority −1 (shadows the shipped rows). Diff data follows the applied wire meta (oldText/newText with ±3 file context) with the call-time argument fallback for PTC sub-calls, so a truncated window that dropped the call head still renders from the result meta
- **Turn summary card**: a `ConversationNodeDefinition` accumulator (`turn/start`, `tool/call`, `tool/result(append)`, `tool/code-dispatch`) publishes Turn data; the `conversation.chat.turnTail` chain claims rendering — modeled on the official `ui-deliverables` plugin. Code-Dispatch files join from the stock chat tool tree, whose `tool-call` nodes already fold every dispatch into its root call's `subCalls`
- **Context boost**: argument-derived hunks are marked by object identity at construction; on expand the booster reads the file through the fenced API (LRU-cached), locates the fragment's post-image and rebuilds the hunk with shared lines. Anything unlocatable renders as-is
- **Host half (optional)**: a same-origin prefix route serves a fenced API (files.read, capture-snapshot per turn, undo, open-with) — realpath containment checked before and after resolution, symlink rejection, UTF-8 round-trip validation, display reads capped at 512 KiB with a truncation flag, a 32 MiB undo gate, and atomic writes. When the host half is absent the dependent actions hide themselves
- **Frosted glass bridge (optional)**: a zero-dependency consumer of the background plugin's `window.__DSH_BACKGROUND_GLASS__` registry — subscribing to its ready event (both arrival orders + hot reload); the bridge never appearing leaves the ordinary UI untouched

## Install

```sh
# from npm
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-diff-stat

# or from GitHub
dsh plugin --profile web add github:HaoyueQin/dsh-diff-stat

# restart dsh web to take effect
dsh web
```

Uninstall:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-diff-stat
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm install        # devDependencies; prepare builds lib/ automatically
pnpm build          # host half → lib/index.js + browser half → lib/client.js (one tsdown run)
pnpm typecheck      # both halves via tsc
pnpm check:align    # diff aligner & data-model assertions (needs Node >= 23.6)
```

> **Kernel compatibility note:** one built bundle targets five harness
> releases — `0.1.1-rc.2`, `0.1.2-alpha.1`, `0.1.2-alpha.2`,
> `0.1.2-alpha.3` and `0.1.2-alpha.4`. Compile-time
> types are pinned to the `0.1.1-rc.2` devDependencies (later client-runtime
> versions are not on public npm); compatibility with newer releases rests on
> runtime shape checks (`narrowDiffs`, snapshot probing) over wire data that is
> byte-identical across all five. A future release that renames or drops those
> wire fields will pass `tsc` silently — verify against the newer release
> before shipping.
