![@picgo/dsh-plugin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PicGo/dsh-plugin/84766fcbda8c9d50d55d0f89865e9c3428db17d4/assets/DeepSeek-PicGo.png)

Upload images and files to your image host from [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), powered by [PicGo](https://picgo.app/).

Harness can show your agent a screenshot, but it has no way to turn a local file into a link. So when the agent writes a README, renders a chart, or captures a screenshot, the image stays on disk and `![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PicGo/dsh-plugin/84766fcbda8c9d50d55d0f89865e9c3428db17d4/out.png)` becomes a dead link the moment you push. This plugin closes that gap.

It uploads through **whatever image host you already configured in PicGo** — PicGo Cloud, GitHub, S3, Tencent COS, Qiniu, or any third-party uploader plugin you installed. Nothing to re-configure. If you've never used PicGo, it walks you into PicGo Cloud's free tier.

If the **PicGo desktop app** is running, uploads go through it, reusing the image host you set up in its window. Otherwise they run in-process. See [Upload routes](#upload-routes).

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @picgo/dsh-plugin
```

Then boot as usual:

```sh
dsh --profile web
```

## What you get

**`picgo_upload`** — a tool the model calls on its own when a local file needs to become a link. Returns structured results, so in Code Mode you can use it directly:

```js
const { uploaded } = await tools.picgo_upload({ paths: ['/tmp/chart.png'] })
console.log(uploaded[0].imgUrl)
```

**`/picgo`** — a command that uploads without spending a model turn:

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/picgo` | Upload the clipboard image |
| `/picgo <path>...` | Upload one or more files |
| `/picgo status` | Show the active host and sign-in state |
| `/picgo login [token]` | Sign in to PicGo Cloud |
| `/picgo logout` | Sign out |

![The /picgo command and the bundled skill in Harness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PicGo/dsh-plugin/84766fcbda8c9d50d55d0f89865e9c3428db17d4/assets/dsh-plugin-picgo.png)

**A bundled skill** that teaches the model *when* to upload — inserting a screenshot into docs is the primary case — and when not to (you named a specific destination, you want a local copy).

## Upload routes

There are two ways this plugin can reach your image host, and it picks one per upload:

1. **The PicGo desktop app**, when it is running. It exposes a local upload server, and using it means your uploads honour the host you configured in the app's window.
2. **In-process PicGo**, otherwise — the `picgo` library reading `~/.picgo/config.json`.

This matters because **the two read different config files**. The desktop app stores its settings in the system application-data directory (on macOS `~/Library/Application Support/picgo/data.json`), while the library reads `~/.picgo/config.json`. If you have only ever used the GUI, the library route sees a config you never touched — most likely empty and defaulting to PicGo Cloud. Preferring the app is what makes "it just uses my existing setup" true.

> **Upgrading from 0.1.x?** If the desktop app is running *and* the two configs point at different hosts, your uploads will now land on the app's host rather than the CLI's. Set `gui.mode: off` to keep the old behaviour.

`/picgo status` tells you which route is active. Two things worth knowing about the desktop-app route:

- The app **copies each URL to your clipboard and shows a notification** — that is the app's own behaviour and this plugin cannot turn it off.
- If an upload there fails with a login error, sign in **from the app's own window**. `/picgo login` writes the PicGo CLI config, which the desktop app does not read.

## First run

If you've never configured PicGo, uploads default to **PicGo Cloud**, which needs a one-time sign-in. The free tier covers casual use.

```
/picgo login
```

That opens your browser and reports back when it completes. If you already have a token from the PicGo Cloud dashboard, `/picgo login <token>` is instant.

The model will never run this for you: with no token the sign-in blocks waiting on a browser callback, which would hang the session. It relays the instruction and waits.

Already using GitHub, S3, or another host in PicGo? None of this applies — your existing config is used as-is and no sign-in is involved.

## Configuration

Every field has a working default. Override them from your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: picgo
  name: '@picgo/dsh-plugin'
  config:
    silent: true
    timeoutMs: 120000
```

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `configPath` | `''` | PicGo config file; empty uses PicGo's own default (`~/.picgo/config.json`) |
| `silent` | `true` | Suppress PicGo's console output and its `picgo.log` writes |
| `timeoutMs` | `120000` | How long to wait for one upload |
| `registerSkill` | `true` | Register the bundled `picgo-upload` skill |
| `registerCommand` | `true` | Register the `/picgo` command |
| `announceSignIn` | `true` | On startup, point a signed-out PicGo Cloud user at `/picgo login` |
| `gui` | see below | How to reach a running PicGo desktop app |

`gui` controls the desktop-app route described in [Upload routes](#upload-routes):

| Field | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `gui.mode` | `auto` | `auto` uses the app when it answers; `off` never tries; `only` requires it rather than uploading to a different host |
| `gui.host` | `127.0.0.1` | Where the app's upload server listens |
| `gui.port` | `36677` | " |
| `gui.secret` | `''` | Auth secret, if you enabled one in the app. Empty falls back to `$PICGO_SERVER_SECRET` |
| `gui.probeTimeoutMs` | `1500` | How long to wait for the app to answer a heartbeat |
| `gui.probeTtlMs` | `5000` | How long a heartbeat result is reused, so a multi-file upload does not re-probe per file |
| `gui.timeoutMs` | `0` | Upload deadline for this route; `0` inherits `timeoutMs` |

A patch replaces a row's **entire** `config` rather than merging keys, so restate every field you want to keep. Within `gui`, unset keys still fall back to the defaults above — overriding `gui.mode` alone is fine.

## Notes

**Uploaded links are public.** Anyone with the URL can open it, and a deleted file may stay cached. Fine for screenshots and doc images; think before uploading a contract PDF or an internal archive. The bundled skill tells the model to confirm first for anything that looks sensitive.

**Your PicGo config is treated as read-only**, with one exception outside this plugin's control: when PicGo Cloud rejects a stored token, PicGo itself clears it from `~/.picgo/config.json`. Signing in and out through `/picgo login` / `/picgo logout` also writes the token, as you'd expect.

**Clipboard uploads need a desktop session** and are only reachable through `/picgo` — the model is never given a way to upload your clipboard, since it can't know what's on it.

**Falling back to the in-process route is deliberately narrow.** If the desktop app stops between the check and the upload, the upload is retried in-process. But a rejected upload, a missing auth secret, or a timeout is reported rather than retried elsewhere: the app may have already accepted the file, and silently re-uploading would put a second copy on a host you did not pick.

**If an upload through the app hangs**, check whether "rename before upload" is enabled in its settings — that opens a dialog and waits for a human, which nothing is going to answer in an agent session. The timeout message says so too.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

`pnpm test:live` additionally exercises the desktop-app route against a running PicGo app. It is kept out of `pnpm test` because it **uploads real files to your real image host**.

To run it against a dsh source checkout without packaging, write a `cordis.dev.yml` (gitignored — the path is specific to your machine):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: picgo
      name: '/absolute/path/to/dsh-plugin/lib/index.js'
```

Then, from the dsh checkout:

```sh
pnpm dsh web --patch /absolute/path/to/dsh-plugin/cordis.dev.yml
```

The path must be absolute: a patch adds config but does not move the loader's resolution root.

### Releasing

`@picgo/bump-version` bumps the version, writes the changelog, commits, and tags in one step:

```sh
pnpm release          # patch: 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1
pnpm release:minor    # 0.1.0 -> 0.2.0
pnpm release:major    # 0.1.0 -> 1.0.0
pnpm release:beta     # 0.1.0 -> 0.1.1-beta.0
pnpm release:dry      # print what would happen, change nothing
```

Then push the tag — that is what triggers publishing:

```sh
pnpm push-release
```

The `release` workflow runs typecheck, tests, and build before publishing, and refuses to publish if the tag does not match `package.json`. Prerelease tags pick their own dist-tag (`-beta.x` → `beta`, `-alpha.x` → `alpha`, anything else prerelease → `next`), so `npm install @picgo/dsh-plugin` never resolves to a prerelease.

#### npm authentication

npm cannot configure a trusted publisher for a package that does not exist yet, so the first release and every later one authenticate differently.

**First release** — needs an `NPM_TOKEN` repository secret (a granular token with publish rights to the `@picgo` scope):

```sh
gh secret set NPM_TOKEN --repo PicGo/dsh-plugin
```

**After that first release lands**, switch to trusted publishing so no long-lived token is involved. On npmjs.com, open the package → Settings → Trusted Publisher, and register:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Publisher | GitHub Actions |
| Organization or user | `PicGo` |
| Repository | `dsh-plugin` |
| Workflow filename | `release.yml` (filename only, not a path) |
| Environment name | leave empty |
| Allowed actions | `npm publish` |

The workflow already sets `id-token: write`, so nothing changes on this side — npm picks OIDC over the token automatically. Once a trusted-publish release succeeds, delete the `NPM_TOKEN` secret and revoke the token, then set Settings → Publishing access to "Require two-factor authentication and disallow tokens".

Trusted publishing needs npm ≥ 11.5.1, so the release workflow runs on Node 24 (which ships npm 11.x). Node 22 ships npm 10.x and fails with a misleading 404. That choice affects only the machine doing the publishing — the package itself still supports Node `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`, and CI tests against 22.

## Compatibility

Tested against DeepSeek Harness `0.1.1-rc.2` (2026-08-22) and PicGo Core 3.0.1. Requires Node `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`.

The desktop-app route needs a PicGo app new enough to expose the local upload server. If yours is older, `gui.mode: auto` simply never finds it and everything runs in-process as before.

Harness is a developer preview and its APIs change often. If a release breaks this plugin, please [open an issue](https://github.com/PicGo/dsh-plugin/issues).
