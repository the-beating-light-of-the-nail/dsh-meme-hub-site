# dsh-plugin-chart

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) that creates AntV chart images directly from natural-language requests.

Provide the data and what you want to communicate. The plugin selects a suitable chart and displays the result in the conversation. Supported formats include line, bar, pie, radar, Sankey, organization, network, and flow charts.

## Requirements

- Node.js `^22.19.0` or `>=24.0.0`
- pnpm on `PATH`
- DeepSeek Harness `0.1.x`

## Install

Install directly from GitHub into the `web` profile:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:lxfu1/dsh-plugin-chart
```

Git-hosted plugins build from source during installation. On pnpm 10 or later, the first command may ask you to allow the `dsh-plugin-chart` build in the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; follow the path printed by dsh, add the exact `allowBuilds` key reported by pnpm, and rerun the same command. Only grant build permission to source you trust.

Start the Web app:

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

## Examples

### Pie chart

```text
A coffee shop's beverage sales breakdown is: coffee 60%, tea 25%, and juice 15%.
Please visualize this beverage sales data using a pie chart and add corresponding text labels.
```
