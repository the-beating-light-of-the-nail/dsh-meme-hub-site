# DSH Browser

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

> Embedded browser for the DSH Web GUI: browse the web and your workspace files
> inside the chat interface — multi-tab, address bar, per-workspace tab
> persistence — plus agent tools (`browser_open`, `browser_read`). Pages are
> rendered by a headless Chromium (Puppeteer) on the host, so sites that send
> `X-Frame-Options` load correctly.

An external plugin package for DeepSeek Harness (DSH). It is a single
dual-face cordis bundle: the host half owns the agent tools, the
`/api/dsh-browser` route family (Puppeteer page proxy + SSE open-event stream
+ workspace file listing/serving), the settings namespace, and the
system-prompt announcement; the browser half renders the sidebar entry, the
multi-tab panel, and the plugin settings card. Hot-pluggable — mounted via
`dsh plugin --profile <name> add link:<repo>`.

> **Platform support.** Works with both DSH Web and Desktop (requires DSH v0.1.1-rc.1
> or later). The visual settings card works out of the box on both platforms —
> no DSH source changes needed. On Web it appears under Settings → Plugins; on
> Desktop it appears as a standalone "Embedded browser" entry in the left nav.

## Prerequisites

A Chromium-based browser must be installed on the host machine (Chrome,
Edge, or Chromium). The plugin auto-detects the executable on Windows, macOS,
and Linux; you can also set an explicit path in the settings card. The plugin
uses `puppeteer-core` (not `puppeteer`), so it never downloads its own
Chromium.

## What it does

- **Entry**: a "Browser" row in the sidebar, below the New Session button.
- **Panel**: takes over the center column with a tab strip, a toolbar
  (back / forward / reload / home / open-in-system-browser), an address bar
  (URL or search, Enter opens), and an iframe content area. Each page is
  rendered by a shared headless Chromium on the host — the proxy route waits
  for `networkidle`, reads the fully-executed DOM, injects a `<base>` and a
  link-interception script, and returns it to the iframe. Inactive tabs stay
  mounted and stateful; iframes lazy-load on first activation.
- **Link interception**: clicks on `http(s)` links inside a proxied page are
  caught and posted to the panel — `target="_blank"` / `window.open` opens a
  new tab, ordinary links navigate the current tab. Nothing ever pops the
  system browser.
- **Tabs per workspace**: the tab set is persisted per project root
  (localStorage, debounced + flushed on page hide). Switching sessions swaps
  the whole tab set; switching back restores it. A configurable cap (default
  10) trims the oldest inactive tab.
- **Workspace browsing**: the new-tab page lists the current workspace
  directory (folders navigate, breadcrumbs, up button); clicking a file opens
  it in the panel through the host's file route. HTML previews get a `<base>`
  injection so relative images/styles resolve, and a CSP `sandbox` header so a
  previewed file can never run scripts in the GUI origin.
- **Agent tools**: `browser_open` pushes a URL into the panel (a new tab opens
  and the panel gains focus); `browser_read` fetches a page from the host and
  returns extracted readable text (static-HTML approximation, no JavaScript).
- **Settings card**: On Web, an "Embedded browser" card appears under
  **Settings → Plugins**; on Desktop, a standalone "Embedded browser" page
  appears in the left navigation. Both support staged edits, save/discard,
  and inherit/reset semantics. Fields: enable, agent announcement, home page,
  tab cap, private-address override, browser executable path, proxy server.
- **Agent announcement**: a system-prompt section tells every agent the plugin
  exists, what its tools do, and its limits (same mechanism dsh-ssh uses).

## Install

```sh
# from a local checkout (development)
dsh plugin --profile <name> add link:<repo>

# from npm (once published)
dsh plugin --profile <name> add @nono-neko/dsh-browser
```

Restart `dsh web`; the sidebar entry appears. The web profile needs the
`@deepseek-ai/*` client packages the bundle injects (any rc.6 web deployment
has them). Make sure a Chromium-based browser is installed on the host.

## Uninstall

```sh
# remove from a profile
dsh plugin --profile <name> remove @nono-neko/dsh-browser

# if installed from a local checkout
dsh plugin --profile <name> remove link:<repo>
```

Restart `dsh web` after removal.

## Configuration

The plugin reads its settings from a layered source: schema defaults, then the
plugin's `cordis.yml` entry (composition base), then the user settings
document. All fields are optional.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | boolean | `true` | Mount the sidebar entry, tools, and proxy routes. |
| `announceToAgent` | boolean | `true` | Inject a system-prompt section telling agents about `browser_open` / `browser_read`. |
| `defaultHome` | string | `https://www.bing.com` | URL loaded by the new-tab / home button. |
| `maxTabs` | number | `10` | Per-workspace tab cap; oldest inactive tab is trimmed. |
| `allowPrivateAccess` | boolean | `false` | Let `browser_read` fetch private / loopback addresses. |
| `browserExecutable` | string | auto-detect | Absolute path to a Chromium-based browser (Chrome / Edge / Chromium). |
| `proxyServer` | string | empty | Route Puppeteer traffic through a proxy, e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:7890`. |

### Visual settings card

The plugin provides an interactive settings form out of the box (requires DSH v0.1.1-rc.1 or later):

- **Web**: **Settings → Plugins → Embedded browser**
- **Desktop**: standalone **Embedded browser** entry in the left nav

| Web settings card | Desktop settings page |
|---|---|
| ![Web settings card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nono-neko/dsh-browser/9d631bab861d97a082dc68dcfa59c1151b5f6669/docs/images/settings-web.png) | ![Desktop settings page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nono-neko/dsh-browser/9d631bab861d97a082dc68dcfa59c1151b5f6669/docs/images/settings-desktop.png) |

### Config file method (without the visual settings card)

If you prefer not to use the visual settings card, set the same fields directly. Two layers are available:

**Plugin entry config** (`cordis.yml` or your profile's plugin config) — the
composition base, applies to every user of that profile:

```yaml
plugins:
  dsh-browser:
    defaultHome: https://www.google.com
    maxTabs: 20
    proxyServer: http://127.0.0.1:7890
```

**User settings document** (`~/.dsh/settings.yaml`) — per-user overrides that
layer on top of the entry config:

```yaml
dsh-browser:
  browserExecutable: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
  allowPrivateAccess: true
```

## FAQ

**Q: Install fails with `ERR_PNPM_GIT_DEP_PREPARE_NOT_ALLOWED`?**

A: This happens when installing from git — pnpm blocks the `prepare` build
script by default. Recommended fix: install from npm instead (pre-built, no
build needed):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add @nono-neko/dsh-browser
```

If you prefer git install, add the package to `allowBuilds` in your profile's
`pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  - '@nono-neko/dsh-browser'
```

## Development

```sh
pnpm install    # @deepseek-ai/* SDK packages are public on npm (or a mirror)
pnpm build      # tsc types + tsdown dual-half bundle (lib/index.js + lib/client.js)
pnpm typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
pnpm test       # vitest
```

The build emits two artifacts from one config: the node half (`lib/index.js`,
esm) and the browser half (`lib/client.js`, a `window.__ModuleLoader__`
closure-factory served at `/plugins/dsh-browser/client.js`). CSS Modules are
compiled into the client bundle by lightningcss; the client bundle enforces a
purity gate — value imports from `@deepseek-ai/*` are only allowed for the
platform seed modules, everything else must inline or go through cordis
services.

## Security model

- **Loopback fence**: every `/api/dsh-browser` route (proxy, SSE, file)
  refuses non-loopback clients (socket address + Host header + same-origin
  markers). A LAN-exposed dsh web cannot serve workspace files or the proxy
  to unpaired devices.
- **Workspace gate**: file listing and serving canonicalize the requested root
  (realpath) and require it to be a registered workspace or inside one;
  every requested path is re-checked after resolution, so symlinks cannot
  escape the root.
- **Served HTML sandbox**: workspace-previewed HTML is served with
  `Content-Security-Policy: sandbox` — scripts never execute in the GUI
  origin (which holds the session's loopback API access).
- **Proxied pages are not sandboxed**: the Puppeteer-rendered HTML is returned
  without CSP / X-Frame-Options so it can render in the panel iframe. The
  loopback fence is the security boundary — only local clients can reach the
  proxy route. Proxied pages cannot access the GUI origin's APIs because they
  are served from a different path and the browser's same-origin policy
  applies to the iframe content.
- **SSRF guard on `browser_read`**: the target hostname is resolved through
  DNS before the request leaves the process and every address must be public
  (private/loopback/link-local/reserved ranges are refused). Redirects are
  followed manually and each hop is re-checked. The `allowPrivateAccess`
  setting is an explicit override; the risk is yours.
- **Proxy route uses Puppeteer**: the headless Chromium fetches the page, so
  the SSRF guard from `browser_read` does not apply to the panel proxy. The
  `proxyServer` setting lets you route browsing traffic through a local VPN /
  proxy.
- **Size/time caps**: `browser_read` bodies over 2 MB answer an error before
  being read; served workspace files over 64 MB are refused; each Puppeteer
  render times out after 30 seconds.

## Limitations

- **No persistent login**: each proxied page opens a fresh Puppeteer page and
  closes it after rendering. Cookies and login state are not retained between
  requests, so sites that require authentication will show a logged-out view.
- **GET only**: the panel proxy supports GET requests. Form submissions (POST)
  and file uploads are not proxied — they will execute inside the iframe and
  may be blocked by the target site's `X-Frame-Options`.
- **JavaScript-rendered navigation**: the initial page is fully rendered by
  Puppeteer, but subsequent in-page navigation (SPA routing, form posts)
  happens inside the iframe and may hit `X-Frame-Options` on the new URL.
  Ordinary `<a>` links are intercepted and re-proxied.
- **`browser_read` sees only static HTML**: JavaScript-rendered pages come
  back without their client-side content, and it cannot use your logins.
- **Browsing consumes real network traffic** on the host machine.
