# dsh-session-folders

[**中文版 README**](README_zh.md) · [**Русская версия README**](README_ru.md)

A session-folders plugin for the DeepSeek Harness web UI: the sidebar workspace browser is replaced with a browser that adds **session folders** — one level of named folders per workspace. Sessions can be dragged into folders or moved via the context menu; folder data is persisted server-side and survives page reloads. Status badges mirror the built-in session browser. No harness changes.

## Features

#### Organization

- **Session folders**: one level of named folders per workspace; sessions outside folders live in the "inbox" (loose) bucket
- **Move sessions**: drag-and-drop a session onto a folder, or use the row context menu — "Move to folder…", with a "New folder…" entry that creates a folder and moves the session into it on the spot; the submenu's "Workspace" entry returns a session from a folder to the loose bucket
- **Folder management**: create, rename, delete (with confirmation); names are unique per workspace (case-insensitive)
- **Inline rename**: double-click a session title to rename it in place — Enter commits, Esc cancels
- **Auto rename**: the session context menu offers "Auto rename" — the session's own model reads its first user message and derives a short title of at most 3 words (a description of the process, feature, or task, in the message's language); the result is pinned like a manual rename
- **Reorder by drag-and-drop**: drag a workspace row to reorder workspaces; drag a folder row to reorder folders inside its workspace (folders stay above the loose sessions, session sorting by time is unchanged); the order is persisted server-side
- **Show more / Show less** in every folder and the Archive block: at most five sessions are shown until the overflow row is clicked; the expanded state is per folder and local to the browser session

#### Session actions

- **Context menus**: every session / folder / workspace row opens its actions menu on right-click (the per-row "…" buttons are removed); each action carries an icon
- **Pin / Unpin sessions**: a pinned session always sits first in its folder or in the loose bucket; the pin is persisted server-side and follows the session when it is moved; a pinned session with no status badge shows a small pin icon in its status slot
- **Quick archive on hover**: hovering a session row swaps the timestamp for a small archive icon — one click archives the session (same as the context-menu action); the swap happens in place, so the layout never shifts
- **Session ID badge**: right next to the quick-archive icon, hovering a session row also reveals a small `ID` badge — one click copies `session-<id>` of that row to the clipboard
- **New session buttons**: a plus icon on a workspace row starts a new session in that workspace; a smaller plus on a folder row starts a session directly inside that folder (the created blank session is moved into the folder and opened)
- **Status badges** Running / Completed — mirroring the built-in session browser

#### Archive & restore

- **Archive block**: an archive icon on a workspace row shows/hides a virtual Archive folder with every archived session of the workspace; while shown, the icon renders struck through. Showing the folder also opens it expanded; it lists the newest archived sessions first (the first five, with a "Show N more / Show less" row), and drops: dropping a session onto it archives it (same as the context-menu action); dropping an archived session onto a folder or the loose area restores it there
- **Restore from the Archive**: a right-click on an archived session offers "Restore to original folder" (the session returns to the folder it was in when archived, or to the loose area); a left-click restores the session into the workspace's **Restored** folder (created on demand) and opens it in chat. Restored sessions are kept apart from the regular ones: the Restored folder always sits first (right below the Archive block) and hides itself whenever it holds no visible sessions

#### Navigation

- **Recent section**: above the workspace list, the five most recent workspace sessions (from folders or the loose area), newest first; clicking one opens it in chat, expands collapsed workspace/folder levels so it is visible, and it stays highlighted both in Recent and in its workspace/folder. The header collapses/expands the section (state persists)
- **Recent origin card**: hovering a Recent session pops a small card to the right of the row showing the workspace and folder it lives in
- **Folder tree guides**: dashed guide lines drop from each folder icon to its sessions; the whole tree of the folder holding the open session paints blue. Toggle in the browser header (on by default)
- **Session search** with match highlighting — by title and content
- **Open workspace folder**: the first button on a workspace row (folder icon) opens the workspace root directory with the operating system's default file manager, via the host's native `openPath` API
- **Collapse / expand all**: the chevron button pair in the browser header folds and unfolds every workspace group, folder, the Recent section and the Archive blocks in one click
- **Workspace focus**: the crosshair toggle on a workspace row (also in its context menu) hides everything else — other workspaces, Recent, Ungrouped — until toggled off; focus resets on restart

#### Persistence & UI

- **Server-side persistence**: folders live in a DSH storage domain and survive page reloads; view state (collapsed folders, etc.) lives in browser localStorage
- **The server is the source of truth**: every action is validated server-side (workspace existence, session membership, name conflicts); the client only mirrors the rules
- **Bilingual UI**: adapts to the page language (zh / en)
- **Collapsed sidebar**: in the narrow rail only the search and new-workspace buttons render, mirroring the built-in browser

## Installation

### From npm

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-session-folders
```

A prebuilt install from the registry — skips the `allowBuilds` build-approval step.

### From GitHub

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:EugeneVl/dsh_session_folders#v0.4.3'
```

**Restart** `dsh web` after installing (the host plugin and the client bundle are loaded at startup).

## Usage

#### Getting started

1. Open the sidebar: in each workspace, folders are shown above the loose sessions

#### Folders

1. **Create a folder** — right-click the workspace row → "New folder"; the name must be unique within the workspace
2. **Rename / delete a folder** — right-click the folder row → "Rename"; deletion asks for confirmation and the folder's sessions become loose
3. **Reorder** — drag a workspace row to a new position; drag a folder row within its workspace (drop on the upper/lower half of a row to place it before/after)

#### Sessions

1. **Move a session** — drag the session row onto a folder (only into a folder of the same workspace), or right-click the session → "Move to folder…" → pick a folder, or "New folder…" to create one and move right away
2. **Move back to the loose area** — right-click the session → "Move to folder…" → "Workspace" (the first entry)
3. **Pin a session** — right-click it → "Pin": the session jumps to the top of its folder (or of the loose bucket) and stays there while other sessions come and go; "Unpin" restores the newest-first order; a pinned session with no status badge is marked with a small pin icon in its status slot
4. **New session** — the plus button on a workspace row starts a session in that workspace; the smaller plus on a folder row starts a session directly inside that folder
5. **Rename a session** — double-click its title (Enter commits, Esc cancels), or right-click → "Rename"
6. **Auto rename** — right-click the session → "Auto rename": the session's model derives a title of at most 3 words from the first user message. Generates nothing while the menu is idle; failures surface in the notice bar
7. **Quick archive** — hover a session row: the timestamp is replaced by an archive icon; click it to archive the session

#### Archive & restore

1. **Archive** — the archive icon on a workspace row shows/hides the virtual Archive folder (every archived session of the workspace, newest first, five at a time). Drop a session onto it to archive it; drag an archived session onto a folder or the loose area to restore it there
2. **Restore** — right-click an archived session → "Restore to original folder" (back where it was); click it to restore into the **Restored** folder, which expands automatically if it was collapsed, and opens the session. The Restored folder is always first and hides itself while empty

#### Find & navigate

1. **Search** — the field at the top of the browser; matches are highlighted and clickable
2. **Recent** — the section above the workspace list shows the five most recent sessions (folders + loose area). Click one to open it; the row in Recent and the workspace/folder icons mark the current session. The header collapses the section
3. **Open the workspace folder** — the folder button (first on the workspace row) opens the workspace root directory in the system file manager

#### View

1. **Collapse / expand everything** — the chevron button pair at the top of the browser:
   - collapse: folds all workspace groups and folders
   - expand: unfolds them again

## How it works

| Layer | Implementation |
|---|---|
| Host | `lib/index.js` — a cordis plug-in: 10 POST routes `/dsh-session-folders/{list,create,rename,delete,move,reorder-folders,reorder-workspaces,pin,unarchive}`; its own storage domain `dsh_session_folders` (one global record holding the folder list); mutations are serialized through a promise tail so two browsers cannot overwrite each other; workspace and session membership are validated via `ctx.workspaceRegistry` |
| Client | `lib/client.js` — a bundle loaded via `window.__ModuleLoader__.load`, registered in the `sidebar.workspaces` slot (priority -1); services `slots / locale / sessions / workspaces`; view state in localStorage (`dsh.session-folders.view.v1`) |

- Folders do not touch session accounting: the workspace owns sessions, folders are only grouping. A session listed in no folder is loose by definition
- Deleting a workspace does not delete folder records: they stop being served (filtered by live workspace ids) and stay harmlessly in storage
- DSH domains guarantee durability-first writes; the storage file is `~/.dsh/storages/dsh_session_folders.json`
- No system-prompt changes, no new model tools — zero token impact

## Limitations

- One folder level only: nested folders are not supported
- A session can only be moved into a folder of the workspace that owns it; a session outside every workspace (unaccounted) cannot enter a folder
- Folder names are capped at 80 characters; duplicate names are rejected (case-insensitive)
- Reordering works with the server as the source of truth: the client submits the full ordered id list and the server validates it (workspaces cannot be dropped outside the live set, folders cannot leave their workspace)

## Compatibility

Current version targets DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` (the `sidebar.workspaces` slot, `webServer / storageDomain / workspaceRegistry` services, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-storage-domain`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-workspace`, `zod`). A DSH upgrade that changes slot/service APIs may require adaptation.

## Development

There is no build step: `lib/` is the committed bundle (host + client). Edit the files directly and syntax-check:

```sh
node --check lib/index.js
node --check lib/client.js
```

Client-side changes (menu items, buttons, rendering) usually only need a browser refresh — the bundle is served on demand; host-side changes (routes, validation) need a `dsh web` restart.

### Release checklist

1. Bump `version` in `package.json` and add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry
2. Commit, tag `vN.N.N`, push master and the tag
3. Point the profile at the new release: `dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:EugeneVl/dsh_session_folders#vN.N.N'`, then restart `dsh web`
