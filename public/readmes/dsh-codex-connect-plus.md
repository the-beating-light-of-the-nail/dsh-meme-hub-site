</p>

> **Use your ChatGPT/Codex subscription inside DeepSeek Harness for Codex models and `gpt-image-2` generation/editing—without an OpenAI Platform API key.**

Sign in once with ChatGPT OAuth. Codex model requests use the signed-in account's subscription capacity; image generation/editing uses the same OAuth session and remains subject to account availability, region, limits, and upstream policy.

### What you get

- **Codex models in the normal DSH model picker** — no separate CLI workflow.
- **`gpt-image-2` generation and editing** — create images from prompts or edit 1–8 local references, with inline previews and local output files.
- **No OpenAI Platform API key or pay-as-you-go API billing setup** — authorization comes from your user-approved ChatGPT/Codex OAuth session.
- **Quota-conscious defaults** — automatic model retries default to `0`, and image requests are never silently retried.

## Features

- ChatGPT/Codex OAuth login and provider-native automatic refresh.
- OpenAI Codex model catalog through Harness's normal LLM service.
- Optional standalone Codex search provider.
- Optional `view_image` tool for vision-capable models.
- `codex_image_generate` for 1-4 `gpt-image-2` outputs.
- `codex_image_edit` for 1-8 local PNG/JPEG/WebP references and an optional mask.
- Durable DSH attachments, session-authorized replay, inline preview, and local files under `outputs/codex-image`.
- Fixed upstream origins, no redirects, bounded inputs/responses, cancellation, timeout, strict image signatures, and redacted provider errors.

## Requirements

- **DeepSeek Harness `0.1.2-alpha.1` or newer.** This release supplies the current pi-ai auth injection and image-request preprocessing budgets. Use `0.1.0-beta.4` only with the older `0.1.0-rc.7` Harness line.
- Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0`.

## Install

Install the public npm beta:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-codex-connect-plus@beta
```

Immutable GitHub fallback:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add 'github:stoneface10/dsh-codex-connect-plus#v0.1.0-beta.6'
```

A matching `.tgz` is also attached to the GitHub prerelease.

For local development:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-codex-connect-plus
```

Source development for this prerelease expects the DeepSeek Harness `0.1.2-alpha.1` checkout in the sibling `../DSH` directory because its workspace packages are not yet published individually on npm.

Do not install `dsh-codex-connect`, `dsh-codex-image-connect`, and this combined package in the same profile: they own the same provider and tool names.

## Configure

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration → Codex Connect Plus**.

1. Sign in with ChatGPT.
2. Keep or change optional capability toggles.
3. Save profile settings.

Default capability and quota-safety settings:

```yaml
modelMaxRetries: 0
enableSearch: false
enableImageTool: false
enableImageGeneration: true
```

The package does not take over the profile's default model or global search route. `modelMaxRetries: 0` avoids silently repeating a full subscription-backed request after a transient failure; users may deliberately select any bounded value from 1 through 10 retries when reliability matters more than quota conservation. Enabled retries use 1–30 second exponential backoff and temporarily include `PI_AI_ERROR` because current pi-ai flattens some Codex WebSocket and server-overload failures into that unclassified code. Image generation/editing remains non-retrying because the provider may already have processed a timed-out request. Leave `enableImageTool` disabled when direct multimodal uploads and DSH's native `read_image` cover the workflow; enable it only when the model must open credential-free public HTTP(S) image URLs directly.

## Image tools

Example requests:

```text
Use codex_image_generate to create a high-quality portrait travel poster.
```

```text
Use codex_image_edit with refs ["photo.png"] to replace the background.
```

Generated files resolve from the current DSH session cwd and are stored under:

```text
outputs/codex-image/
```

Reference images are limited to 4 MB each and 8 images per edit request. Generation can take several minutes. A timeout or transport failure is not retried automatically because the upstream may already have processed the request.

## Security and API status

- OAuth credentials remain in DSH's dedicated credential file. On POSIX systems the plugin checks owner-only permissions; do not copy, commit, or disclose this file.
- Refresh is performed by the pi-ai Codex provider through the locked credential store; the image module neither stores nor refreshes refresh tokens itself.
- Image requests use fixed HTTPS ChatGPT/Codex application endpoints and reject HTTP redirects.
- Before provider-controlled errors are surfaced, their length is bounded and recognized Bearer tokens, JWTs, authorization/token fields, `b64_json`, and image data URLs are redacted.
- Generated attachment reads are authorized through the owning DSH session; the plugin exposes no public attachment-reading route.

Codex Images uses an unpublished, changeable ChatGPT/Codex application backend, not a public or supported OpenAI Platform API. The feature may stop working after upstream changes; availability depends on the user's account permissions, subscription, region, limits, and upstream policy. Users are responsible for complying with applicable service terms.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check
npm pack --dry-run
```

The repository intentionally commits both `src/` and generated `lib/`, matching the upstream distribution model. The npm/Release `.tgz` includes runtime files and documentation, but excludes source, tests, scripts, credentials, logs, and local outputs.
