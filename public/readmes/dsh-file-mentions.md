[![Awesome DSH Plugin](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com/badge.svg)](https://awesome-dsh-plugin.com)

**Clickable file paths in DSH replies** — a DeepSeek Harness (DSH) web plugin with a Codex-style experience.

*Unofficial project: independently developed and maintained by a community member, not an official DeepSeek product.*

## Screenshot

![dsh-file-mentions in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions/21d8da94b174e37eda13274e74c4ed2459be612e/assets/screenshot.png)

Inline paths wrapped in backticks (`` `~/...` ``, absolute, relative, or Chinese paths) become
**click-to-open**; each clickable path carries a small folder-icon button that reveals the file in your
file manager; a "📎 mentioned files" chip list at the turn tail covers the rest. URLs are
already auto-linked by the official renderer, so this plugin leaves them alone.

![External-drive whitelist settings](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions/21d8da94b174e37eda13274e74c4ed2459be612e/assets/screenshot-settings.png)

The external-drive whitelist (Settings → Plugins → file-mentions): **local files in your home
directory are clickable by default**; only external drives / network volumes (e.g.
`/Volumes/USB`) need their root added here — one path per line. System-disk marker
directories (`/System`, `/etc`) are rejected automatically.

## Features

| Where | What | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Inline path text | click | Open with default app / open directory |
| folder icon after inline path | click | Reveal in file manager |
| "📎 mentioned files" chip | click name | Preview content inside DSH |
| folder icon in the chip list | click | Reveal in file manager |
| Inline URL | click | Browser opens it (official autolink) |

Supports `~/` expansion, relative paths (resolved against the session cwd), and absolute
paths in macOS / Linux / Windows forms. Non-existent paths silently do nothing.

## Install

This repository is an official **bundle plugin** (`dsh.bundle` + `dsh.client` in the root
`package.json`), installed through the official profile manager:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions#main"
```

Then **restart `dsh web`** (bundle layers are composed at startup; HMR does not apply).
Requires `pnpm` on PATH (`dsh plugin` forwards to pnpm).

Manual mount fallback: see [docs/install.md](docs/install.md).

## Usage

Have the agent wrap paths in backticks (e.g. `` `~/docs/plan.md` ``) to make them clickable
inline. The tail chip list appears automatically — no configuration.

### Paths outside the session directory (external drives, etc.)

Local files inside your **home directory** (e.g. `~/Downloads`, `~/Desktop`) are clickable by
default — no configuration needed. For paths on an **external drive / network volume** (e.g.
`/Volumes/USB`), add that root to the **external-drive whitelist** in Settings → Plugins →
file-mentions (one path per line). Saving takes effect immediately — no restart required.

System-disk protection: whitelist roots containing system marker directories (`/System`,
`/etc`, or `\Windows` on Windows) are rejected automatically, so a full system disk mounted
externally can never be whitelisted by mistake.

## Platform support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| macOS | ✅ Fully tested (incl. Chinese paths) |
| Linux | ⚠️ Not tested — expected to work (command branching and path parsing implemented) |
| Windows | ⚠️ Not tested — expected to work (command branching and path parsing implemented) |

## Requirements

- DSH web >= 0.1.0-rc.6 (run with `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web`)
- **Version compatibility** (best effort — the settings card uses dual-field `key`+`id` registration to satisfy both rc.6 (`id`) and rc.7+ (`key`); verified locally on rc.6/rc.8/0.1.1-rc.2, **not guaranteed on every DSH version**):
  - DSH 0.1.0-rc.6 and newer (incl. 0.1.1-rc.1/rc.2): try `main` (default).
  - Conservative fallbacks (the last pre-0.1.1 build): DSH 0.1.0-rc.7/rc.8 → `v1.0.8` (`dsh plugin add github:a903067276-rgb/dsh-file-mentions#v1.0.8`); DSH 0.1.0-rc.6 → frozen `rc6-compat` tag (no maintenance).
- Pure Node stdlib implementation — peer dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings`,
  `@deepseek-ai/schemastery`) are provided by the host
- Opening files uses the system default app / file manager (per-platform command branching)
- **Maintenance policy**: this plugin keeps evolving with the latest DSH releases; compatibility with older DSH versions is best-effort only and not guaranteed going forward.

## How it works

- **Host** (`lib/index.js`): three routes — `/api/file-mentions/check` (existence check),
  `/api/file-mentions/open` (system open, `mode: open/reveal`, per-platform command) and
  `/api/file-mentions/config` (whitelist read/write for the settings page). All three routes
  are same-origin guarded. Probe surface: absolute/`~/` paths are checked only inside the session cwd or
  user-declared whitelist roots (stored via the official settings service — immediate
  effect, no restart); whitelist roots are protected against system disks and symlink
  escapes. Pure Node stdlib; `execFile` avoids shell injection.
- **Client** (`lib/client.js`): a conversationEvents collector extracts paths from each
  reply → publishes them to turn data → the tail list filters non-existent paths before
  rendering; inline clicks use a **document-level click delegation** (the official render
  entry is occupied by the official "deliverables" plugin, so DOM delegation is the only
  viable path); inline folder-icon buttons are inserted by a MutationObserver and restored
  automatically after React re-renders; a settings card (sidebar section + plugin page)
  edits the whitelist.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Notes

- Use either the official bundle install or the manual mount — never both.
- Manual mounting needs a **single entry** in `~/.dsh/cordis.patch.yml`; a double entry
  applies the plugin twice and crashes on duplicate route registration.

## Compatibility notes

- Inline clicks rely on backtick-wrapped paths (the agent-output convention, same as
  Codex); bare paths in prose are intentionally not clickable.
- The official "produced files" list and this plugin coexist: official wins when it has
  output, otherwise this plugin shows.
- Windows / Linux validation via issue or PR is welcome.
