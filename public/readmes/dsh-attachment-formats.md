> **DeepSeek Harness plugin (`dsh-plugin`) for the Web GUI** — `dsh plugin add` one-liner. Makes the composer accept PDF, Office (docx/xlsx/pptx), TIFF, epub/odt/rtf, long-document text and scanned-PDF OCR, Codex-style. Keywords: `dsh`, `deepseek-harness`, `cordis`, `pdf-extraction`, `tesseract`, `deepseek-vision`, `files-api`.

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) web plugin (`dsh-plugin`, Cordis) that
makes the composer accept many more attachment formats, Codex-style. Zero core-package
changes: a pure plugin that reuses the harness-native image draft rail, upload limits,
history rendering and model request pipeline.

| PNG / JPEG / WebP / GIF | native pipeline (plugin not involved) | image draft rail (native) |
| **PDF (with text layer)** | text-layer extraction (≤40 pages via the pymupdf4llm high-fidelity engine; larger/unavailable falls back to pdfjs) | full text on a **document card** (merged on send); over-limit → workspace spill + index card |
| **PDF (scanned / no text layer)** | tesseract.js OCR (accepted only at confidence ≥45), falls back to page images | OCR success → text channel; failure → image draft rail (vision models only) |
| **Word (.docx) / Excel (.xlsx) / PPT (.pptx)** | text extraction — docx via mammoth HTML → turndown, **tables kept as Markdown pipe tables** | document card (merged on send); over-limit → spill + index card |
| **Legacy .doc / .xls / .ppt** | LibreOffice headless → docx/xlsx/pptx → standard Office pipeline (needs `soffice`; clear error when absent) | document card (merged on send) |
| **epub / odt / rtf** | pandoc → Markdown (probe on PATH); epub/odt fall back to jszip+turndown without pandoc; rtf requires pandoc | document card (merged on send) |

| iWork / audio-video / archives | — (not yet supported; explicit notice, skipped) | — |

## Document cards (Codex-style mounting, composer stays clean)

Text-like attachments that are dragged in or picked are **not stuffed into the input
box**: their content mounts as a **document card** above the composer (file name +
character count + full-text/index label, individually removable), while images keep
flowing into the native image draft rail. You type normally, and **at the moment of
sending** the plugin merges the card content into the message (with
`[attachment: <file name>]` provenance markers) before the native submit — your prompt
always stays on top and no content is lost:

- each card has a **send** button: send documents even without typing anything;
- pressing Enter / the native send button merges the cards first, then submits;
- cards are not merged while the model is mid-reply (they stay put for later).

## Long documents (index-card mode, never silently truncated)

Text beyond 80k characters and long multi-page PDFs are **not stuffed into the message**.
Instead:

1. the host spills them into the session workspace `.dsh-attachments/<sha-16>/`
   (content-addressed, reused on re-drop, auto-cleaned after ~7 days of no access):
   - `doc.md` — PDF text layer assembled per page (leading `<!-- pN -->` markers),
     Office-extracted text, long text as-is (long JSON is prettified to `doc.json`);
   - `pages/pNN.png` — rendered page images (≤100 pages, for vision models via
     `read_image`; rendered lazily, only when the index-card path needs them);
   - `manifest.json` — source, page/line/char counts, engine, full source SHA-256
     and the converter-policy fingerprint (engine/OCR/doc-server switches invalidate
     the cache automatically);
   - `INDEX.md` (cache root) — the aggregated list of every spilled document in this
     workspace.
2. the message carries only a few-hundred-token **index card**: page/line/char counts,
   an outline (PDF heading heuristics, md headings, JSON first-level key tree) and
   reading pointers.
3. the model reads page-by-page with the stock `read` tool (offset/limit, line numbers
   as coordinates) — full summaries read through (no dropped tails), targeted lookups
   jump by outline; missing content is an explicit tool failure, never silent loss.

Design rationale and evidence: `docs/design-longdoc.md`; comparison with similar work:
`docs/alternatives.md`. Upgrades for current limitations (researched GitHub solutions
and v0.6 roadmap): `docs/upgrade-v6.md`.

## Engines & OCR (v3)

- **PDF text engine**: `auto` (default) → the venv's pymupdf4llm for ≤40 pages
  (high-fidelity tables/headings); pdfjs (seconds) for larger documents or when the
  venv is missing. Env: `DSH_ATTACH_ENGINE=auto|python|builtin`.
- **Scanned-PDF OCR**: python (PyMuPDF, needs system tesseract) → tesseract.js (pure JS;
  first use downloads the ~24MB eng/chi_sim language data into `vendor/tessdata/`).
  Confidence below 45 falls back to page images with a clear reason. Env:
  `DSH_ATTACH_OCR=auto|baidu|tesseract-js|off` (see below).

## Fidelity & format coverage

- **DOCX tables**: mammoth HTML → turndown + GFM plugin — tables survive as Markdown
  pipe tables (replaces the old cell-by-cell reading order).
- **TIFF**: decoded by sharp (libvips prebuilt binary) into PNG pages, multi-page
  supported (≤20 pages per file).
- **epub / odt / rtf**: pandoc (probed on PATH) converts to Markdown; without pandoc,
  epub/odt fall back to in-process jszip + turndown, rtf reports a clear install hint.
- **Legacy .doc / .xls / .ppt**: LibreOffice headless (`soffice`, probed on PATH plus
  the usual Windows install locations) converts to the modern OOXML format first, then
  the standard Office pipeline runs. Each run uses an isolated `UserInstallation`
  profile to avoid lock conflicts.
- **PDF outlines**: bookmark TOCs (`get_toc` / pdfjs `getOutline`) now feed the index
  card's outline first; the font-size heuristic is only the fallback. Empty-bookmark
  PDFs are unaffected.

## Cloud OCR & content-adaptive engine (zero new heavyweight deps)

- **Baidu OCR API** (preferred scanned-PDF OCR, free tier: 1,000 calls/month for
  personal accounts / 2,000 for enterprise on both 标准版 and 高精度版, per the
  official free-quota page): pages are sent as JPEG via plain HTTPS — no new
  dependencies. Configure via env:
  - `BAIDU_OCR_API_KEY` / `BAIDU_OCR_SECRET` (console → 文字识别 → create app);
  - `DSH_ATTACH_OCR=auto|baidu|tesseract-js|off` (auto = Baidu when credentials
    exist, else local tesseract.js);
  - `DSH_ATTACH_OCR_ACCURATE=1` for the high-accuracy endpoint (separate free
    quota).
  Quota exhausted / API failure → automatic fallback to local tesseract.js with a
  note; forced `baidu` mode reports the reason instead.
- **Remote VLM OCR** (optional, token-billed): `DSH_ATTACH_VLM_BASE` /
  `DSH_ATTACH_VLM_MODEL` (+ optional `DSH_ATTACH_VLM_KEY`) point at any
  OpenAI-compatible vision endpoint (olmOCR-2, GLM-4V, Qwen-VL…). Pages are
  transcribed one by one via chat/completions. In `auto`, only the first configured
  cloud provider receives a document; failure falls back to local tesseract.js.
  Cross-cloud retry is explicit opt-in (`DSH_ATTACH_CROSS_CLOUD_FALLBACK=1`).
- **Content-adaptive PDF engine**: documents of 41–160 pages now let the Python
  engine decide by vector density (sampled `get_drawings`) — text-heavy manuals
  skip the slow high-fidelity pass and go straight to the fast pdfjs engine, while
  table/graphic-heavy documents still get pymupdf4llm. ≤40 pages are unchanged.

## External doc server, cache page & workspace zero-copy

- **External document parser** (optional): `DSH_ATTACH_DOC_SERVER=<base URL>`
  points at a parser service (PP-StructureV3 `paddleocr serve`, MinerU, or any
  shim). Contract: `POST {base}/convert` with multipart field `file` →
  `{ "ok": true, "markdown": "..." }`. When configured, PDFs go to the server
  first; any failure falls through to the local engine chain.
- **Attachment cache settings page**: Settings → 附件缓存 lists every spilled
  document (size/engine/time) with per-item delete and clear-all, backed by
  `GET /api/attach-formats/cache` + `POST .../cache/delete` + `POST .../cache/clear`.
- **Workspace zero-copy**: text files between 512KB and 16MB are first resolved
  against the session workspace: the browser reads the file locally to compute its
  full SHA-256, then `GET /api/attach-formats/resolve` asks the host to confirm a
  same-source file by **name + size + full SHA-256** (bounded ~2.5s walk skipping
  dependency dirs). A hit mounts a 📎 reference card — the **content is not
  uploaded** (only the name, size and hash are sent); the model reads the path with
  its `read` tool. A miss falls back to the normal upload pipeline. Files over 16MB
  are rejected outright (no zero-copy attempt).

## Context adaptation & full-text command (v2b)

- **Adaptive merge limit**: the client reads the token-meter `contextPressure` projection
  (model context window × current usage); the full-text merge limit becomes
  min(80k chars, headroom × 1.5) — when headroom is short, the card automatically turns
  into an index card with a status-bar note, so merged content can never blow up the
  context and get silently truncated by the API. A missing projection falls back to the
  fixed 80k threshold.
- **`/attach` command** (composer slash menu, host-registered):
  - `/attach list` — list the spilled documents in this workspace (id/name/size/engine);
  - `/attach full <id|name>` — merge the full text into model context as a next-step
    message (**takes effect on the next message**, current turn untouched); 300k-char cap
    with an explicit truncation notice — never silent loss. `read` still works afterwards
    for line-precise lookup.

## Interactions

- **Paperclip button**: composer tool row (`conversation.input.left`), opens a
  multi-select file picker whose `accept` list covers every format in the table above.
- **Drag & drop**: drop a PDF / Office / text file anywhere on the page.
- **Paste**: copy a file and Ctrl+V into the composer (or the whole page).

Native image drag/paste stays on the harness built-in pipeline; when a single drop mixes
other formats in, the plugin takes over the whole batch (converts first, then hands the
produced images back to the built-in draft rail as a "synthetic drop").

```

- The host route re-sniffs magic bytes and never trusts the client-declared kind; 160MB
  request cap and 64MB per-file cap; `cwd` is read by the client from session state and
  sent with the request (it decides where the spill lands).
- On dsh v0.1.2+, all exact plugin routes reuse the host connection's launch-token and
  Host/Origin checks; v0.1.1 keeps its legacy localhost trust boundary.
- Tiered thresholds: full-text merge cap 80k chars (v2b lowers it adaptively by context
  headroom); spill page images ≤100 pages (1100px wide; PNG over the per-image byte
  budget falls back to JPEG); scanned-page image cap follows the deployment limit; OCR
  ≤20 pages per run (2000px wide), confidence <45 falls back to page images.
- Converted page images mount through the harness's **official per-session
  injection face** (`ctx.conversation.createDraftImages` + `input.addImages`,
  dsh ≥ v0.1.1) — attachments always land in the conversation you are looking
  at, never in another idle dialog. On older hosts the plugin falls back to the
  legacy synthetic drop (which waits for the current conversation to become
  idle first).
- Document-card content merges at send time through the official composer
  write path (`setDraft`, phase-gated: plain drafts only, command claims are
  never polluted). Composer detection supports both the v0.1.1 textarea and the
  v0.1.2 Lexical `contenteditable`; the textarea DOM bridge remains an older-host
  fallback. The image path is fully independent and untouched.
- Conversion progress/errors show in a temporary status bar above the composer
  (`conversation.input.dock`); success auto-hides after 6s, errors can be dismissed.
- Page-image rendering targets the host's normalization byte budget
  (`normalizationPolicy.maxBytes`) instead of the raw admission bound, so
  rendered pages are not re-compressed a second time by the dsh ≥ v0.1.1
  canonical image pipeline.

## Quick install (dsh plugin)

> Search: `dsh attachment` · `dsh pdf` · `dsh office` · `dsh ocr` · `cordis pdf plugin` — this plugin answers those queries.

From GitHub (recommended, `dsh-plugin` topic for discoverability):

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add github:linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats
```

From npm (when published, enables `keywords:dsh-plugin` search):

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-attachment-formats
# or
npm install dsh-attachment-formats
```

Local development:

```powershell
cd path\to\dsh-attachment-formats
npm install            # host dependencies (first time)
# optional: high-fidelity PDF engine (pymupdf4llm, self-contained venv)
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install pymupdf4llm
npm run smoke          # offline smoke tests (optional)
dsh plugin --profile web add link:path\to\dsh-attachment-formats
```

Restart `dsh web` (close the page → the desktop shortcut auto-restarts, or re-run
`dsh web`) and refresh the browser. OCR language data downloads automatically on the
first scanned-PDF recognition (≈24MB, cached in `vendor/tessdata/`, offline-ready
afterwards).

## Known limitations

- OCR (tesseract.js) quality is limited on low-resolution scans and complex tables;
  insufficient confidence falls back to page images with an explicit note — garbled text
  is never injected. Higher-quality OCR (RapidOCR/MinerU/PaddleOCR) can be added as
  pluggable backends later (see `docs/upgrade-v6.md`).
- The pymupdf4llm high-fidelity engine handles ≤40-page PDFs only (larger documents use
  the fast pdfjs engine); table/formula reconstruction is good but not typesetting-grade
  — layout details can be cross-checked against page images.
- Scanned PDFs without a text layer can only go the page-image route when OCR is
  unavailable or fails (vision models can read them).
- Legacy `.doc/.xls/.ppt` require LibreOffice (`soffice`); `rtf` requires pandoc;
  `epub/odt` work out of the box but pandoc (if installed) gives better fidelity.
  Missing binaries produce clear, actionable errors — nothing is silently dropped.
- DOCX formulas and embedded images are not extracted (tables, headings and text are).
- XLSX outputs displayed text/results only; charts and comments are not extracted.
- Outlines prefer bookmark TOCs; PDFs without bookmarks fall back to font-size
  heuristics (weak on documents without strong heading styling) — the index card still
  carries line/page counts and reading pointers.
- iWork and archives are not converted yet.
- Attachments are attributed to the shell's **current conversation** (the one being
  viewed). On dsh ≥ v0.1.1 the official injection face addresses that session
  exactly; on older hosts the synthetic-drop fallback can be caught by other
  *idle* conversations — prefer attaching images with a single conversation
  open there (text/code files are unaffected: they always stay in the current dialog).
- The DOM event bridge is now only a fallback for hosts without the official
  input face; if it breaks, the symptom is "card content didn't enter the
  message" on legacy hosts only, and the card's **send** button is the
  fallback (synthetic Enter path). The image path is never affected.

## Releases

- **v0.12.0** — raw binary uploads replace base64 JSON on the default client path;
  OOXML/epub/odt ZIP containers gain entry-count, per-entry, total-size and compression-
  ratio budgets; attachment supersession is isolated per session; credentials move to
  the host store before ordinary settings are written; automatic OCR no longer forwards
  one document to multiple cloud providers unless explicitly enabled.

- **v0.11.1** — dsh v0.1.2-alpha.1 compatibility: Lexical composer detection and
  host launch-token/Host/Origin enforcement for plugin routes; v0.1.1 remains supported.

- **[v0.10.0](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.10.0)**
  (latest) — Codex-parity UX + hardening: chunked upload progress (XHR) and a
  host-side job channel streaming per-page render/OCR progress into the status
  bar; card click opens a page-image lightbox (new path-traversal-guarded
  `/api/attach-formats/file` route); large-file base64 encoding moved into a
  Web Worker with sync fallback; secrets written through the official
  `ctx.credentials.set` seam (config keeps references, not values); doc-server
  URL SSRF guard (http/https only, no userinfo); `verify:build` freshness gate.
- **[v0.9.0](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.9.0)**
  (latest) — dsh-philosophy alignment: conversion cache moves to
  `$DSH_HOME/storages/attachment-docs/<workspaceHash>/` by default (workspace
  mode now opt-in; legacy `cwd/.dsh-attachments` auto-migrates once per
  workspace); DeepSeek Vision joins the `auto` OCR chain when a key is
  detected (toggleable, first transcription notes token billing); credentials
  resolve through the official `ctx.credentials` seam with file-parse
  fallback; settings gain revision CAS (`expectedRevision` → 409 on conflict)
  and a cache-location picker; smoke suites isolate `DSH_HOME`.
- **[v0.8.0](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.8.0)**
  — settings page for all external APIs (no more required env): 8 OCR
  providers (Baidu / Aliyun AppCode / Tencent TC3 / Azure Document Intelligence
  / Volc / generic VLM / local tesseract.js / off) + 6 doc-parser presets
  (PaddleOCR / MinerU / Marker / Docling / custom / off), persisted under
  `DSH_HOME` with masked readback; zero-config **DeepSeek Vision OCR**
  (reuses the host's DeepSeek key, tables → GFM); vision provenance badges on
  chips; `sharp`/`@napi-rs/canvas` moved to `optionalDependencies` with
  three-state probes; `.gitignore` marker injection + `/api/attach-formats/doctor`.
- **[v0.7.0](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.7.0)**
  — adaptation to dsh v0.1.x attachment pipeline: image limits
  resynced to the normalization-era defaults (20MiB/200MiB/64MP/8192px per
  side + `maxImageDimension`), page-image rendering now targets the host's
  `normalizationPolicy.maxBytes` budget; converted images attach through the
  official per-session injection face (`createDraftImages` + `addImages`,
  no more cross-conversation drops on v0.1.1+); document cards merge via the
  official `setDraft` write path (command claims never polluted); the cache
  settings page moves to the rc.7-standard `settings.plugins.tab`; `/attach`
  declares `images: false` and `/attach full` uses the `agent.inject()`
  alias; DOM bridge and synthetic drop remain as legacy-host fallbacks.
- **[v0.6.4](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.6.4)**
  — session-correct attachments & verified zero-copy: attachments now
  attribute to the shell's current conversation (no more cards/images landing in
  another dialog); converted images wait for the current conversation to become
  idle before the synthetic drop; workspace zero-copy is confirmed by name + size +
  full SHA-256 (no silent substitution), >16MB is rejected outright; INDEX.md cells
  are escaped, INDEX rebuilds are serialized per workspace, cache hits keep the
  source-count fields, legacy-Office manifests carry the `libreoffice+builtin`
  engine label.
- **[v0.6.3](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.6.3)**
  — cache lifecycle hardening: v0.6.1 8-hex cache dirs are now swept by
  cleanup/clear (no invisible orphans), JSON spill keeps source vs artifact sizes
  separate (tiering uses the spilled `doc.*` size), page images materialize lazily
  when a cache hit downgrades to index mode, INDEX.md is fully rebuilt from live
  manifests (no ghost rows, populated timestamps), legacy `.doc/.xls/.ppt` cache
  keys use the original OLE bytes so hits skip LibreOffice, atomic manifest/INDEX
  writes.
- **[v0.6.2](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.6.2)**
  — cache correctness & fast path: 16-hex cache ids with full SHA-256 in the
  manifest, converter-policy fingerprint (engine/OCR/doc-server switches invalidate
  the cache), index cards rebuilt from structured metadata on every hit (no filename
  bleed-through), TTL counts model `read` access via file atime, page images rendered
  lazily (clean small PDFs skip rasterization), 2–16 MB text files reach the host
  spill instead of being rejected, React key warnings eliminated, Node >=20, CI
  actions upgraded to v7.
- **[v0.6.1](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.6.1)**
  — correctness & engineering fixes: attachment-dock crash fix (`useCallback`
  reference), converters no longer pre-truncate (never-silent-truncation restored
  end-to-end), session-derived workspace authority for all routes, XLSX empty-column
  coordinate fix, true conversion cache keyed by source hash, cache TTL based on last
  access, verified merge into the composer draft; added ESLint, CI (Node 20/22) and
  component-level smoke tests.
- **[v0.6.0](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.6.0)**
  — fidelity & format coverage (DOCX tables, TIFF, epub/odt/rtf, legacy
  Office, PDF bookmark outlines), Baidu OCR API + remote VLM OCR + external doc
  server, content-adaptive engine, attachment cache settings page, workspace
  zero-copy references.
- **[v0.5.0](https://github.com/linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats/releases/tag/v0.5.0)**
  — document cards, index-card spill, `/attach list|full`, adaptive merge limit,
  pymupdf4llm/pdfjs engines, tesseract.js OCR.

## Model experience

Extracted text and OCR transcripts enter the model context only when the user
sends the merged message (document cards) or reads the spilled `doc.md` via
the `read` tool — the plugin itself submits nothing. Vision OCR
(`deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` or a configured cloud provider) is billed by
that provider; the first transcription of a batch notes it in the card notes.
Index cards carry absolute workspace paths (default cache home) or relative
ones (workspace mode), so `read`/`read_image` resolve in both modes.

#### KV Cache effect

Conversion results are content-addressed and reused verbatim across sends
(cache hits add zero new tokens beyond the index card itself). Switching
engines/OCR providers changes the converter-policy fingerprint and invalidates
old caches, so a provider swap re-transcribes on the next drop rather than
serving stale text.

## FAQ — search-friendly

**Q: How to add PDF support to DeepSeek Harness Web?** `dsh plugin --profile web add github:linkingoscar/dsh-attachment-formats` — PDFs extract text-layer (pymupdf4llm/pdfjs), scanned PDFs OCR via tesseract/DeepSeek Vision, long docs spill to index cards.

**Q: Does it work with Office (docx/xlsx/pptx) and TIFF/epub?** Yes — docx tables → Markdown pipes, xlsx → TSV, pptx → per-slide text, TIFF → PNG, epub/odt → Markdown via pandoc/jszip.

**Q: What about dsh file-upload vs drag-and-drop?** This plugin is an alternative to `dsh-drag-and-drop`/`dsh-at-file`/`dsh-file-uploads`: it converts content (not just paths) so text-models can read PDFs; zero-copy via SHA-256 for workspace files keeps uploads low.

**Q: Which OCR backends?** `auto` selects the first configured cloud backend in the
Baidu → VLM → Aliyun/Tencent/Azure/Volc → DeepSeek order, then falls back locally;
cross-cloud retry is opt-in. All backends are optional and no heavyweight model is bundled.

**Q: Where are docs cached?** `DSH_HOME/storages/attachment-docs/<wsHash>/` (default), opt-in workspace mode `.dsh-attachments/`, 7-day TTL, `INDEX.md` + `read`/`read_image`.

- Curated lists: [awesome-dsh-plugin](https://github.com/awesome-dsh-plugin/awesome-dsh-plugin), [dshplugin.world](https://dshplugin.world), [deepseekharness.io/plugins](https://deepseekharness.io/plugins), [dsh.pub](https://dsh.pub) — PRs welcome; this plugin declares `dsh.bundle` so it qualifies for manifest-verified discovery.
- Keywords: `dsh`, `dsh-plugin`, `deepseek-harness`, `cordis`, `pdf-extraction`, `office`, `tiff`, `ocr`, `tesseract`, `deepseek-vision`.

## Known limitations

- The DeepSeek key file fallback parses `.credentials.yaml` with a minimal
  regex; if the host's credential format changes, the plugin falls back to
  local tesseract with a warning (the official `ctx.credentials` seam is
  tried first).
- `auto` Vision requires a detectable DeepSeek key; without one it silently
  skips to local OCR (explicit `deepseek` mode reports the reason instead).
- Legacy `.doc/.xls/.ppt` need LibreOffice; `rtf` needs pandoc; heavy parsers
  (MinerU/Marker/PaddleOCR) are external services only — never bundled.
- iWork and archives are not converted.
