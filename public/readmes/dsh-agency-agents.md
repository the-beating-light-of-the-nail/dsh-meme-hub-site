> DSH Agency Agents is a community-maintained DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin, not an official DeepSeek AI product.

## Features

Choose a specialist in DSH for code review, design, operations, or research. All 321 experts are bundled and ready to use after installation.

- **Find the right expert**: filter by category or search in **Settings → Experts**.
- **Enable the roles you need**: keep the picker focused by enabling or disabling experts.
- **Describe the task directly**: use `@` or the **Experts** picker, then write your complete request.
- **Get one final delivery**: experts provide specialist analysis and the parent conversation brings the results together. Experts cannot summon further experts.

## Screenshots

Filter by category or search in **Settings → Experts**, then enable the experts you need:

Use `@` or the composer's **Experts** picker to choose an enabled expert:

The localized expert name is inserted as a short tag; write the complete task next:

## DSH product ecosystem

For a ready-to-use workbench, download [DSH Codex Desktop](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/releases). If you already use [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), install any of these eight plugins individually. The desktop app includes all eight.

| Plugin | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| [Codex UI](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-ui) | Organize projects and conversations, search tasks, and navigate chat turns |
| [IM Connect](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-im-connect) | Send tasks and receive replies through your usual messenger |
| [Automation](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-automation) | Schedule tasks and review each run |
| [Skills Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-skills-manager) | Find, enable, create, and import local skills |
| [Archive Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-archive-manager) | Search, restore, or clean up archived conversations |
| [Agency Agents](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents) | Choose and summon specialists for your task |
| [BTW](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-btw) | Ask side questions without interrupting the main task |
| [Simplify](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-simplify) | Use /simplify to improve code within your Git changes |

## Prerequisites

- A working DeepSeek Harness Web installation with `dsh` available in PowerShell.
- Examples use the `web` profile; replace it with the target profile.
- Source installation and development require Node.js 22+ and pnpm. npm installation does not require running `pnpm install` separately.

## Installation

The installation commands below use the official npm registry.

### Ask an agent to install it (recommended)

Send the prompt below to any agent that can run terminal commands on your computer. Replace `web` with your actual profile. Once installed, use the plugin in DSH.

```text
Install the DSH plugin @michengai/dsh-agency-agents into my local web profile by running: dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-agency-agents@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/. Then run dsh --profile web --dump-config, confirm the configuration includes agency-agents, agency-agents-remote, and explain how to reload DSH and start using the plugin.
```

### Install the latest package from the official npm registry

Run this from any PowerShell directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-agency-agents@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

To pin a release, replace `@latest` with a version such as `@0.1.17`.

The configuration output should contain `agency-agents` and `agency-agents-remote`. Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. Do not copy client files manually: the Settings page needs the mounted Remote service.

## Updates

The settings title shows the installed version and a **Check for updates** button. When a newer release is available, **Update automatically** runs only when the DSH CLI or Desktop update service is available; otherwise, the dialog provides a profile-specific manual command to copy and run.

## Usage

1. Open **Settings → Experts** and enable the needed experts.
2. Use `@` or the composer **Experts** picker to choose an enabled expert.
3. The localized expert name is inserted as a short tag. Continue with the complete task.

```text
Code Reviewer

Review the changes in the current workspace and list reproducible issues by severity.
```

The parent session can also call `list_experts(division?)`, then delegate with `summon_expert(expert, task)` using the expert name. The bundled roster validates localized and upstream names for uniqueness.

### 🔍 Research Division

Evaluating sources and synthesizing evidence into traceable findings.

| Agent | Specialty | When to Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔍 [Research Synthesist](assets/agency-agents/research/research-synthesist.md) | Literature review, source evaluation, citation tracing, evidence synthesis | Turning a scattered pile of sources into a structured, honestly-weighted map of what the evidence supports |

## Configuration and limits

| Key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Bundled expert assets | External expert root; an explicit value takes priority. |
| `provider` | `spawn` | DSH subagent provider; `fork` also works when it supports persona and tool filtering. |
| `divisions` | 22 standard divisions | Top-level divisions to scan. |
| `maxDepth` | Unset | Positive absolute subagent-depth limit. |

Set `AGENCY_AGENTS_ROOT` to use an external expert directory. Persona bodies from that directory are injected as the child system prompt, so load them only from a trusted source. The provider must support persona and tool filtering. `summon_experts` accepts at most 8 experts with a concurrency of 4 and still returns successful answers when some experts fail.

## Secondary development

### Install from source

Use this for debugging or unpublished changes. The cloned directory becomes the plugin source path:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
Set-Location D:\Repository\deepseek-harness-plugin
git clone https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents.git
Set-Location .\dsh-agency-agents
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. `dsh plugin ... add .` reads the package metadata and `cordis.patch.yml`; do not install by copying `lib` directly.

- [src\index.ts](src/index.ts): host entry point for catalog loading, tools, and settings.
- [src\remote-contract.ts](src/remote-contract.ts) and [src\remote.ts](src/remote.ts): Remote contract and implementation.
- [src\client\index.ts](src/client/index.ts): Settings page, composer button, and `@` trigger.
- `assets\agency-agents`: bundled personas; retain its MIT license and [NOTICE](NOTICE) attribution.

After changing `src` or `assets`, rebuild, test, and install from the local directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm verify
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

The published package includes `lib`, `assets`, the patch, and the root README/license files. Do not publish `node_modules` or local development files.

## Validation

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm verify
```

`prepublishOnly` runs these build, test, and package-integrity checks before publishing.
