> DSH Agency Agents is a community-maintained DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin, not an official DeepSeek AI product.

## Features

- Filter by category or search, then enable or disable bundled experts in **Settings → Experts**.
- Summon enabled experts by their localized name from the composer's **Experts** picker.
- Use `list_experts` to discover experts and `summon_expert` to start a one-shot specialist subagent.
- Use 273 bundled personas immediately, or connect a separately synchronized expert directory.
- Paste one sentence into DSH, Codex, or WorkBuddy and let that agent install the plugin locally.

The parent session keeps task context, judgment, and the final answer. Expert children provide a specialist perspective only and cannot summon further experts.

## Screenshots

Filter by category or search in **Settings → Experts**, then enable the experts you need:

Use `@` or the composer's **Experts** picker to choose an enabled expert:

The localized expert name is inserted as a short tag; write the complete task next:

## DSH product ecosystem

This product can be installed independently or used through the desktop app or Web suite. They share the same DSH core but serve different ways of working:

| Product | Relationship to this product |
| --- | --- |
| [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) | The host runtime that provides models, sessions, tools, and the plugin system |
| [DSH Codex Desktop](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop) | A ready-to-install desktop product with this product and the other five feature products built in |
| Six feature products | [Codex UI](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-ui) · [IM Connect](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-im-connect) · [Automation](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-automation) · [Skills Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-skills-manager) · [Archive Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-archive-manager) · [Agency Agents](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents) |

## Prerequisites

- A working DeepSeek Harness Web installation with `dsh` available in PowerShell.
- Examples use the `web` profile; replace it with the target profile.
- Source installation and development require Node.js 22+ and pnpm. npm installation does not require running `pnpm install` separately.

## Installation

`dsh plugin add` forwards to `pnpm add` in the profile directory. Without a version and official registry, a local mirror or minimum-release-age policy can leave you on an older build.

### Ask another agent to install it

This plugin runs inside DeepSeek Harness Web. Copy one of the sentences below into DSH, Codex, or WorkBuddy and let that agent install it into your local `web` profile.

From npm:

```text
Install the latest DSH plugin @michengai/dsh-agency-agents into my local web profile using the official npm registry: dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-agency-agents@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/. Then run dsh --profile web --dump-config, confirm agency-agents is mounted, and remind me to restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser.
```

From source:

```text
Install the DSH plugin from source at https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents: clone it, run pnpm install --frozen-lockfile and pnpm build, then run dsh plugin --profile web add . from that directory. Do not copy lib by itself. Then run dsh --profile web --dump-config, confirm agency-agents is mounted, and remind me to restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser.
```

| Product | How to use it |
| --- | --- |
| DSH | Send one of the sentences above to the current session. |
| Codex | Send one of the sentences above to Codex and let it install locally. |
| WorkBuddy | Send one of the sentences above to WorkBuddy; for a source install you can also paste `https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents`. |

Codex and WorkBuddy only install the plugin. After that, open DSH Web and use **Settings → Experts**.

You can also run the same npm command yourself:

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-agency-agents@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
```

If `dsh` is not on PATH, replace the leading `dsh` with `npx --yes @deepseek-ai/dsh`.

### Install the latest package from the official npm registry

Run this from any PowerShell directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-agency-agents@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

To pin a release, replace `@latest` with a version such as `@0.1.17`.

The configuration output should contain `agency-agents` and `agency-agents-remote`. Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. Do not copy client files manually: the Settings page needs the mounted Remote service.

### Install from source

Use this for debugging or unpublished changes. The cloned directory becomes the plugin source path:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
Set-Location D:\Repository\deepseek-harness-plugin
git clone https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents.git
Set-Location .\dsh-agency-agents
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. `dsh plugin ... add .` reads the package metadata and `cordis.patch.yml`; do not install by copying `lib` directly.

## Usage

1. Open **Settings → Experts** and enable the needed experts.
2. Use `@` or the composer **Experts** picker to choose an enabled expert.
3. The localized expert name is inserted as a short tag. Continue with the complete task.

```text
Code Reviewer

Review the changes in the current workspace and list reproducible issues by severity.
```

The parent session can also call `list_experts(division?)`, then delegate with `summon_expert(expert, task)` using the expert name. The bundled roster validates localized and upstream names for uniqueness.
## Configuration and limits

| Key | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `root` | Bundled expert assets | External expert root; an explicit value takes priority. |
| `provider` | `spawn` | DSH subagent provider; `fork` also works when it supports persona and tool filtering. |
| `divisions` | 18 standard divisions | Top-level divisions to scan. |
| `maxDepth` | Unset | Positive absolute subagent-depth limit. |

Set `AGENCY_AGENTS_ROOT` to use an external expert directory. Persona bodies from that directory are injected as the child system prompt, so load them only from a trusted source. The provider must support persona and tool filtering. `summon_experts` accepts at most 8 experts with a concurrency of 4 and still returns successful answers when some experts fail.

## Secondary development

- [src\index.ts](src/index.ts): host entry point for catalog loading, tools, and settings.
- [src\remote-contract.ts](src/remote-contract.ts) and [src\remote.ts](src/remote.ts): Remote contract and implementation.
- [src\client\index.ts](src/client/index.ts): Settings page, composer button, and `@` trigger.
- `assets\agency-agents`: bundled personas; retain its MIT license and [NOTICE](NOTICE) attribution.

After changing `src` or `assets`, rebuild, test, and install from the local directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm verify
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

Handoff and iteration notes stay in the local `docs` directory and are not tracked in Git; a fresh clone will not include that handover entry.

The published package includes `lib`, `assets`, the patch, and the root README/license files. Do not publish `node_modules` or local development files.

## Validation

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm verify
```

`prepublishOnly` runs these build, test, and package-integrity checks before publishing.
