# dsh-crypto-portfolio

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

A free, 100% self-hosted [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) plugin that unifies your **on-chain and CEX assets** into one self-contained web dashboard.

> Unofficial project, independently developed and maintained by community members.

## Why it exists / The pain points

I built it because the pain points are real.

### 1 · My money lives in seven places, and checking the total means opening six pages

EVM assets in DeBank, SOL and staking on-chain, BTC in a block explorer, plus Binance / Bybit / Backpack — each with its own app. Checking "how much do I actually have" meant hopping between six pages, and it was easy to miss a wallet along the way.

**This plugin puts all of it on a single screen.**

### 2 · Assets that block explorers can't see

Some money is genuinely invisible: native Solana stake accounts (`getParsedStakeAccounts` misses them), Hyperliquid L1 staked HYPE and spot balances, exchange earn/funding accounts. None of these are plain SPL/ERC-20 tokens, so ordinary tools never read them.

**This plugin digs them out and prices them into your total** — including the 12.1 SOL staked in the account above and the ~318 HYPE staked on Hyperliquid.

### 3 · Dust coins and phishing tokens inflate the numbers

DeBank lists plenty of fake tokens — ETHG, for example, is a **phishing token with a manipulated price** that once inflated one account by $570K.

**One-click blacklisting**: every token you blacklist is removed from totals, trends and historical snapshots instantly.

### 4 · "How much did I have last week?"

Without history there's no peace of mind.

**Every refresh saves the last snapshot of the day** (SQLite, deduplicated by day); over time it draws a trend line that is uniquely yours:

## What it does

- **A zero-dependency web dashboard, launched from a real DSH plugin.** No framework, no CDN — Python stdlib + vanilla JS.
- **Covers BTC / EVM / Solana / Hyperliquid L1 / CEX.** DeBank's 73 chains, BTC P2SH+P2TR, native Solana staking, Hyperliquid's official API (staked HYPE + spot + perp equity), and read-only CEX keys (named `<exchange>_read`).
- **Global filters.** Category (BTC / EVM / Solana / CEX), wallet and chain dropdowns drive every panel — total, wallet-share pie, trend, chain distribution, token table.
- **Free + paid data sources, clearly labeled.** EVM uses DeBank with two providers: paid `debank-pro` (badged "PAID", with a registration link) and free keyless `debank-public` fallback; CEX rows always show Binance/Bybit/Backpack with "get API key" links to each exchange. Each source displays when it last succeeded.
- **Automatic API failover.** Each source has several providers (prices: CoinGecko → Binance → Coinbase → OKX; BTC: blockchain.info → mempool.space; multiple Solana RPCs; Hyperliquid dual endpoints). A dead provider is skipped and the last working one is remembered.
- **Scheduled daily refresh.** Every profile can auto-refresh at a local time (server-side daemon; closing the browser page does not stop it); per-source last-success timestamps are shown in Settings.
- **Multi-profile configs.** The `default` profile ships with public template wallets (vitalik.eth, genesis BTC, public SOL) and empty keys; your private wallets and keys live in a separately named profile with its own snapshot history.
- **Themes & i18n**: light/dark theme toggle, EN / 中文 (English by default), chain/exchange logos throughout.

## How it integrates with DSH

Not a wrapper — a real plugin:

- Declares a `dsh.bundle` manifest (`cordis.patch.yml`), so it installs with `dsh plugin add`.
- `apply(ctx)` hooks into the Cordis lifecycle: seeds user-local `profiles/default` from public templates on first run, spawns the dashboard as a child process, and stops it cleanly on `ctx.on('dispose')`.
- Exposes JSON APIs (`GET /api/refresh`, `/api/history`, `/api/tokens`, ...) that an agent can call directly, in addition to the web UI.

## Privacy (important)

This repository contains **no private keys, no private wallets, no balances** — `tracker/config.py` ships with `WALLETS = []` and empty keys. All private configs live in git-ignored local `profiles/`. Clone it, review it, run it with confidence.

## Install

Requirements: Python 3.9+ (`requests`; `pynacl` is bundled in `vendor/`).

```sh
# from a DSH source checkout
dsh plugin --profile demo add /path/to/dsh-crypto-portfolio
dsh --profile demo
# dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8080 (PORTFOLIO_PORT to override)
```

Or run standalone (no DSH):

```sh
python3 run.py --init-template --port 8080   # seeds profiles/default from public templates
```

## Layout

```
profiles/default/   sources.json + wallets.json (public template, auto-seeded)
templates/          public example configs (no secrets)
tracker/            backend fetchers (debank/btc/solana/hyperliquid/cex/prices)
static/             web dashboard (vanilla JS, no external deps)
run.py / fetch.py   web server / CLI snapshot
```
