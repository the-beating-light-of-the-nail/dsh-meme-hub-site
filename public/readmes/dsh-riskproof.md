# RiskProof

**Provenance-aware execution security for DeepSeek Harness.**

Track where tool inputs came from. Detect risky cross-tool data flows. Stop sensitive side effects before execution.

## What RiskProof answers

Most tool-permission plugins answer one question: *is this tool allowed?*

RiskProof answers a different one:

> **Where did the data in this tool call come from, what did it flow through, and where is it about to go?**

A single tool call is usually safe. The composition is not.

```text
web_fetch          ← UNTRUSTED_WEB
   │
database_query     ← CUSTOMER_DATA
   │
send_email         ← external destination
   │
RiskProof → DENY   (evidence-backed, before the side effect)
```

## Why RiskProof

| Permission rules          | RiskProof                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Is this tool allowed?     | Where did this data come from?         |
| Single call               | Cross-tool flow                        |
| Tool name                 | Provenance + taint                     |
| Static rule               | Stateful attack chain                  |
| Permission decision       | Evidence-backed execution decision     |

RiskProof is a layer over the DSH Tool Runtime, not another Agent Runtime. It never re-implements tool dispatch, approval, or lifecycle — it observes and decides.

## Quick Start

```bash
# add the plugin to a DSH profile
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add dsh-riskproof@0.2.1

# confirm the bundled patch was composed
dsh --profile <profile> --dump-config
```

The package declares a DSH bundle, so `plugin add` composes its `riskproof` row automatically. No second install or manual row is required. The schema defaults are safe; RiskProof silently tracks context and only asks or blocks when a risky cross-tool flow appears.

Version 0.2.1 is tested with DSH 0.1.0-rc.7, 0.1.0-rc.8,
0.1.1-rc.2, and 0.1.2-rc.1. Pinning this version also prevents a package
manager release-age policy from resolving the incompatible 0.2.0 build.

To tune it, override the bundled row from the profile's later `cordis.patch.yml` layer:

```yaml
- id: riskproof
  config:
    mode: enforce            # enforce | observe
    policy:
      preset: balanced         # permissive | balanced | strict
      internalDomains: [acme.internal]
      blockedDomains: [collector.evil.example]
      # allowedExternalDomains: [api.approved.example]
    classification:
      overrides:
        gmail_send: [EXTERNAL_ACTION]
        company_db: [PRIVATE_ACCESS]
```

See [docs/configuration.md](docs/configuration.md) for the full reference.

## See it work

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Agent
    participant T as DSH ToolRuntime
    participant R as RiskProof

    A->>T: web_fetch(url)
    T->>R: tools/pre-execute
    R-->>T: allow (EXTERNAL_INGESTION recorded)
    T-->>A: untrusted content

    A->>T: database_query(sql)
    T->>R: tools/pre-execute
    R-->>T: ask (operator approves private access)
    T-->>A: CUST-8842 balance 125000

    A->>T: send_email(to=external, body=CUST-8842…)
    T->>R: tools/pre-execute
    R-->>T: DENY — ingestion + private access + sensitive data + external action
    T-->>A: Error: <reason>
```

The same flow is reproduced as a deterministic regression test in [tests/security/attack-chain.test.ts](tests/security/attack-chain.test.ts).

Try it locally with no model or profile — a real DSH ToolRuntime pipeline with three mock tools:

```bash
npm run demo
```

See [demo/README.md](demo/README.md).

## Features

### Track data origin

Know where tool inputs came from. RiskProof maps arguments back to the tool results that produced them.

### Follow sensitive data

Carry security labels — `UNTRUSTED_WEB`, `CUSTOMER_DATA`, `PII`, `SECRET`, … — across tool calls, additively.

### Detect attack chains

Identify the `EXTERNAL_INGESTION → PRIVATE_ACCESS → EXTERNAL_ACTION` pattern that single-tool checks miss.

### Stop before execution

Block or ask *before* the side effect runs, through the native `tools/pre-execute` gate.

### Guard sensitive surfaces

Gate credential-file paths, high-confidence destructive commands, download-and-execute pipelines, blocked destinations, and credentials embedded in network-capable commands.

### Adapt without rewriting rules

Start with the default `balanced` preset, roll out with `permissive`, or use `strict`; every configurable decision can still be overridden individually.

### Explain every decision

Generate structured, privacy-preserving security evidence and actionable remediation for every decision. Keep proofs in memory or append them to an operator-controlled JSONL file.

## How it works

RiskProof hooks the native DSH tool pipeline:

```text
tools/pre-execute
    │  capability classification
    │  argument provenance mapping
    │  taint analysis
    │  toolchain state (EIT → PAT → NAT)
    │  deterministic policy evaluation
    ▼
allow / ask / deny   (monotonic with other plugins)
    │
tools/result
    │  update ContextTracker
    │  update Toolchain state
    ▼  record execution evidence
```

- **Classification** is deterministic (tool name + description + schema), configurable, and never uses an LLM.
- **Provenance** uses exact and bounded substring matching over a per-session context index.
- **Taint** is additive; ordinary tool output can never remove a label.
- **Decisions** are deterministic, explainable, and testable.

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Security boundaries

RiskProof protects **supported observable tool-call flows** through DSH:

- DSH tool calls through the supported `tools/pre-execute` / `tools/result` paths
- supported observable provenance (exact / bounded substring matching)
- configured sensitive flows and cross-tool attack patterns

RiskProof does **not** replace:

- OS sandbox / process isolation
- network firewall / SSRF protection
- endpoint security / malware scanning
- credential vaults
- full semantic DLP

See [docs/security-model.md](docs/security-model.md) for the complete threat model and known limitations.
