E-Ink Retro is a client-side theme for DeepSeek Harness. It uses neutral paper surfaces, near-black type, hard offset shadows, compact corners, and black-and-white selection states. The geometry takes cues from classic Macintosh interfaces while keeping the DSH layout and workflows recognizable.

## Highlights

- Balanced mode applies the paper-and-ink shell while keeping semantic status colors and user media.
- Immersive mode maps supported DSH surfaces and compatibility layers to a monochrome ink ramp.
- Links, menus, form controls, tree items, and other adapted elements share a visible keyboard focus treatment.
- Images, attachments, video, canvas output, and iframe content keep their original rendering.
- Theme settings follow the DSH page language in English or Simplified Chinese, with English as the fallback.
- The theme pauses when you select another third-party theme.

## Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Balanced** | Applies the paper-and-ink shell and control language. Semantic status colors and user content remain available. |
| **Immersive** | Maps supported DSH surfaces, status tokens, and verified compatibility layers to grayscale. User media remains unchanged. |
| **Off** | Releases the theme token layer and removes the active root attribute. The plugin stays installed. |

## Install

Requirements:

- DeepSeek Harness with a `web` profile
- Node.js 20 or newer
- `pnpm` available to the DSH plugin command

Install the tagged GitHub release:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:exoticknight/dsh-theme-eink-retro#v0.2.0
```

Restart DSH Web after installation, then open **Settings → E-Ink Retro**.

### Update

Install the newer release tag, replacing the version in the command:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:exoticknight/dsh-theme-eink-retro#vX.Y.Z
```

Restart DSH Web after changing versions. The tag is intentionally pinned, so updates are explicit and reversible.

### Disable or remove

Clear **Enable theme** in **Settings → E-Ink Retro** to stop applying the theme without removing the plugin.

Remove the package from the profile:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-theme-eink-retro
```

Restart DSH Web after removal. The plugin removes its injected style and token layer during unload. Two local mode preferences remain in browser storage so a later reinstall can restore your last selection.

### Roll back

Install a specific release tag again:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:exoticknight/dsh-theme-eink-retro#v0.1.0
```

## Use

Open **Settings → E-Ink Retro**, enable the theme, then select Balanced or Immersive.

Selecting another third-party theme pauses E-Ink Retro. Enabling E-Ink Retro or changing its mode while a third-party theme is active switches DSH back to System. Returning to a built-in System, Light, or Dark theme restores the selected E-Ink mode.

## Compatibility

The `v0.2.0` release was built and checked with:

| Component | Version or environment |
| --- | --- |
| DeepSeek Harness | `0.1.1-rc.2` |
| Node.js | `24.19.0` |
| pnpm | `11.19.0` |
| Operating system | Windows `10.0.26200.0` |

DSH is in developer preview. A future DSH release may change UI hooks or theme tokens and require a plugin update.

### Compatibility boundaries

The theme uses DSH semantic tokens and verified component surfaces. Components that consume those tokens inherit the palette.

- Native select menus may use operating-system styling after they open.
- Plugins with hard-coded colors, Shadow DOM, or isolated rendering inherit only part of the theme.
- The optional `dsh-context` adapter targets the `v0.31.x` interface.
- High-contrast and print media have explicit fallback treatments. This project does not claim full WCAG certification.

## Privacy and storage

E-Ink Retro runs in the DSH client. Its host entry performs no theme work.

- It uses the DSH runtime, theme, and settings services.
- It changes DOM attributes, CSS, and theme tokens.
- It stores two mode preferences in browser `localStorage`.
- The current source contains no network requests, telemetry, conversation access, or file access.
- Removing the plugin does not delete the two stored mode preferences.

## Support

Report problems through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/exoticknight/dsh-theme-eink-retro/issues). Include the DSH version, plugin version, E-Ink mode, built-in DSH theme, screenshot, and reproduction steps.

## Install from source

Clone the repository, install dependencies, and build:

```sh
npm install
npm run build
```

Link the checkout into DSH:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-theme-eink-retro
```

Windows example:

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add link:C:/path/to/dsh-theme-eink-retro
```

## Development

Run the complete local check before submitting a change:

```sh
npm run check
git diff --exit-code -- lib
npm pack --dry-run
```

The main implementation files are:

- `src/client/tokens.ts`: Balanced tokens and the Immersive ink-ramp overlay
- `src/theme.css`: design tokens, component geometry, interaction states, and compatibility adapters
- `src/client/index.ts`: mode storage, token installation, DSH theme coordination, settings, and cleanup
- `tests/theme.test.mjs`: package, release, and theme-boundary regression checks

Conventions:

- Keep theme CSS under `html[data-dsh-theme-eink-retro]`. The plugin settings block uses `.eink-retro-settings` because it must remain readable while the theme is off.
- Put authored colors behind `--eink-*` tokens. A component may consume an official `--dsw-*` semantic token when that token represents the component's DSH surface role.
- Use `--eink-rule` for separators and static surfaces. Use `--eink-rule-strong` for operable or floating surfaces.
- Keep monochrome compatibility adapters under the `immersive` attribute selector.
- Do not add a global media filter. A generated class selector requires a comment explaining why no stable hook exists.
- Localized accessible-name selectors must use substring matching, include every supported locale, and carry a structural constraint.
