## Why this exists

Conversation history lives inside the DSH Web UI, and sharing a meaningful part of it usually means screenshots spliced by hand — cropped, misaligned, with no brand or context. This plugin lets you pick an exact range of a conversation with two draggable, magnetically snapping markers and render it into a single polished PNG long image with a DeepSeek Harness branded footer.

## Features

- **Share capsule** to the left of the Session log button in the top-right corner (same style as log; clicking activates a blue highlight, with `[Cancel][Confirm]` expanding to its left)
- **Two draggable range markers** (horizontal labels: "Start here" / "End here") with magnetic snapping
  - Snap points = semantic message rows + markdown blocks (p/pre/ul/li/table/headings) + visual boxes (code blocks/cards) + content-level buttons (artifact file chips) + every text line inside paragraphs
  - The start handle snaps to an element's **top edge**, the end handle to its **bottom edge**; the two handles cannot cross
  - Snap hint = light blue translucent rounded-rect fill (flat style)
- **Scrolling model**: handles follow the pointer 1:1 within the viewport without scrolling; only when the pointer enters the top/bottom edge zones (64px) does the page scroll (clamped penetration depth, frame-rate independent), stopping when it leaves; clicking does not scroll (a real drag of ≥8px is required)
- **Capture**: 40pt theme-background padding (symmetric on all sides) + a DeepSeek Harness brand icon at the bottom (with the BETA badge text); extra-long content is rendered in chunks and stitched together to bypass the canvas height limit
- **Preview modal**: image width adapts, vertical scroll to review, download PNG, copy image

## Usage

1. Click the share capsule next to the Session log button in the top-right corner; it activates (blue highlight) and the `[Cancel][Confirm]` controls appear
2. Drag the two range markers to select the conversation range — they snap to message rows, markdown blocks, and line-level text; the start handle snaps to a top edge, the end handle to a bottom edge
3. Click **Confirm** to render the selection into a PNG long image (extra-long content is chunked and stitched automatically)
4. Review the result in the preview modal: download the PNG or copy the image to the clipboard

## Install

Install into the `web` profile with the standard `dsh plugin` mechanism (no source changes, no manual package.json edits):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:omdsh-dev/dsh-conversation-share

# Or pin a branch/commit
dsh plugin --profile web add github:omdsh-dev/dsh-conversation-share#main

# Or install from a local checkout (development — rebuild and it takes effect)
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/your/dsh-conversation-share
```

Internally the command runs `pnpm add <spec>` in the profile directory and automatically appends packages that declare `dsh.bundle` to `dsh.profile.bundles`. The repository ships its build output (`lib/`), so no consumer-side build is needed.

After installing, **restart web** and **hard-refresh** the browser (Cmd+Shift+R) — old tabs do not load the new bundle.

### Upgrade

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update github:omdsh-dev/dsh-conversation-share
```

For a local-path installation, run `add` again against the replacement checkout, then restart web and hard-refresh.

### Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-conversation-share
```

The command runs `pnpm remove <pkg>` in the profile directory and removes it from `dsh.profile.bundles`. After uninstalling, **restart web** and **hard-refresh** the browser.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| Share capsule does not appear | The plugin only loads after restarting web and hard-refreshing the browser; verify the bundle row exists in the profile (`dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep conversation-share`) |
| Handles cannot cross or snap oddly | That is by design — the start handle snaps to top edges, the end handle to bottom edges, and they cannot cross; drag past an element to flip which edge binds |
| The page scrolls while dragging | Scrolling only happens in the 64px top/bottom edge zones; drag within the viewport to move the handle 1:1 without scrolling |
| Confirm does nothing / blank image | Ensure the selection covers at least one message; the capture pipeline chunks and stitches extra-long content, so very long ranges may take a moment |
| Copied image is missing from the clipboard | The browser may have blocked clipboard image writes; use **Download PNG** instead |

## Build

Requires a DSH checkout (the official repository or a snapshot directory both work):

```sh
DSH_CHECKOUT=/path/to/dsh-checkout node scripts/build.mjs
# or via pnpm:
DSH_CHECKOUT=/path/to/dsh-checkout pnpm run build
```

The script temporarily symlinks the DSH checkout's `node_modules` into this directory (cleaned up automatically when the build ends) and runs `tsc` (type check) then `tsdown` (producing `lib/index.js` + `lib/client.js`).

## Development and verification

```sh
pnpm run check     # tsc --noEmit
DSH_CHECKOUT=/path/to/dsh-checkout pnpm run build   # -> lib/ (committed)
```

`lib/` is committed so consumers install without building. Changes to the share flow (markers, snapping, capture, preview) should be exercised against a live web profile and the built bundle committed in the same change.

## Release

1. Make sure the build output is up to date:

   ```sh
   DSH_CHECKOUT=/path/to/dsh-checkout node scripts/build.mjs
   ```

2. Bump the version, update `CHANGELOG.md`, commit and push to `main`, and tag the release:

   ```sh
   git add . && git commit -m "release v0.1.x" && git push origin main
   git tag v0.1.x && git push origin v0.1.x
   ```
