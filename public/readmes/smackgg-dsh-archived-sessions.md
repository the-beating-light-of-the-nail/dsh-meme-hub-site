# dsh-archived-sessions

[简体中文](https://github.com/smackgg/dsh-archived-sessions/blob/main/README.zh-CN.md)

An installable [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) **plugin bundle** that adds an **Archived** settings page and restores archived sessions.

## Features

- Lists archived sessions with their title, workspace, and last update time.
- Searches archived sessions and filters or groups them by project.
- Restores a session from **Settings → Archived → Unarchive**.
- Synchronizes restored sessions back to the existing Harness sidebar.
- Ships Host and Web Client capabilities in one DSH bundle.
- Validates its Host/Client RPC boundary with strict Typert descriptors.

## Requirements

- DeepSeek Harness `0.1.0-rc.6`
- The `web` profile, or another profile that includes the Harness Web UI

Harness does not currently expose a public unarchive API. This plugin serializes the state update through the workspace registry hooks available in the pinned Harness version. Compatibility tests intentionally fail if those hooks disappear in a future release.

Harness also does not expose a safe session-deletion API. The page includes the planned single-session and bulk-delete entry points, but they currently explain this limitation instead of deleting storage files directly. This avoids corrupting session indexes or history; deletion can be enabled once Harness publishes an official API.

## Install

### From GitHub

Pin a release tag or commit so later repository changes cannot alter the code you run:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:smackgg/dsh-archived-sessions#<tag-or-commit>
```

### From a local checkout

```bash
git clone https://github.com/smackgg/dsh-archived-sessions.git
dsh plugin --profile web add /absolute/path/to/dsh-archived-sessions
```

### From npm

After an npm release is published:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-archived-sessions@0.1.0
```

This repository commits runnable JavaScript, so GitHub installs do not require a package build or pnpm `allowBuilds` permission.

## Verify and run

Inspect the composed profile before starting it:

```bash
dsh --profile web --dump-config
dsh --profile web
```

Open **Settings → Plugins → Plugin list** and search for `archived-sessions`. The mounted module should be enabled. The installable package is named `dsh-archived-sessions`; Harness shows the module ID in this list. The restore UI is available under **Settings → Archived**.

Restart a running Harness or desktop client after installing or updating the plugin.

## Update

Install a newer pinned tag or commit:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add github:smackgg/dsh-archived-sessions#<new-tag-or-commit>
```

## Uninstall

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-archived-sessions
```

Restart Harness after removal.

## Desktop integration

Desktop clients can ship this package as a locked production dependency and apply its exported `cordis.patch.yml` during profile startup. In that setup, desktop users do not install the plugin separately.

Do not both install the bundle into the same profile and have a desktop client inject it again: duplicate Loader rows or Remote namespaces will fail during startup.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run pack:check
```

The package follows the official DSH bundle layout:

```text
.
├── package.json       # dsh.bundle and dsh.client manifests
├── cordis.patch.yml   # Loader row contributed by the bundle
└── src/
    ├── index.js       # Host restore service
    ├── client.js      # Web settings UI and Client Remote mount
    ├── typert.host.js
    └── typert.remote-client.js
```
