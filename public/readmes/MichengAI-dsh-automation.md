> DSH Automation is a community-maintained DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin, not an official DeepSeek AI product.

## Features

Let DSH handle work on a schedule. Set up tasks in Settings or describe the timing and requirements in a conversation, then review each run.

- **Run once or repeat**: choose intervals, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or every N days.
- **Choose the working environment**: set the directory, model, skills, and permissions.
- **Adjust the schedule anytime**: create, pause, resume, run immediately, or delete tasks.
- **Review results**: browse task conversations by name and run time in the **Scheduled** tab, or filter run history in Settings.
- **Keep each run independent**: each run uses the saved task instructions and does not inherit the conversation that created it.

## Interface

Scheduled tasks live in the workspace **Scheduled** tab, next to **Tasks** and **Channels**:

Open **Settings → Scheduled Tasks** to search, create, pause, and inspect rules:

Describe the job in chat. DSH handles approval according to the selected permission mode:

After approval, the rule is saved and summarized in the conversation:

Run history stays in Settings and can be filtered by day, week, month, task, or status:

## DSH product ecosystem

For a ready-to-use workbench, download [DSH Codex Desktop](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop/releases). If you already use [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), install any of these eight plugins individually. The desktop app includes all eight.

| Plugin | What you can do |
| --- | --- |
| [Codex UI](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-ui) | Organize projects and conversations, search tasks, and navigate chat turns |
| [IM Connect](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-im-connect) | Send tasks and receive replies through your usual messenger |
| [Automation](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-automation) | Schedule tasks and review each run |
| [Skills Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-skills-manager) | Find, enable, create, and import local skills |
| [Archive Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-archive-manager) | Search, restore, or clean up archived conversations |
| [Agency Agents](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents) | Choose and summon specialists for your task |
| [BTW](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-btw) | Ask side questions without interrupting the main task |
| [Simplify](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-simplify) | Use /simplify to improve code within your Git changes |

## Prerequisites

- A working DeepSeek Harness Web installation with `dsh` available in PowerShell.
- Examples use the `web` profile; replace it with the target profile.
- Source installation and development require Node.js 22.19+. npm installation does not require running `npm install` in an arbitrary directory.

## Installation

The installation commands below use the official npm registry.

### Ask an agent to install it (recommended)

Send the prompt below to any agent that can run terminal commands on your computer. Replace `web` with your actual profile. Once installed, use the plugin in DSH.

```text
Install the DSH plugin @michengai/dsh-automation into my local web profile by running: dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-automation@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/. Then run dsh --profile web --dump-config, confirm the configuration includes dsh-automation, and explain how to reload DSH and start using the plugin.
```

### Install from npm

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-automation@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. Pin a version with `@0.1.5` instead of `@latest` when needed.

## Updates

The settings title shows the installed version and a **Check for updates** button. When a newer release is available, **Update automatically** runs only when the DSH CLI or Desktop update service is available; otherwise, the dialog provides a profile-specific manual command to copy and run.

## Usage

Open **Settings → Scheduled Tasks**, then use the panel as follows:

| Goal | Action | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create a rule | Select **New scheduled task**, then set name, schedule, prompt, workspace, model, skills, and permission. | Host-wide |
| Create from chat | Describe the schedule in any conversation, or select **Create in chat**. | Current conversation |
| Pause or resume | Use the switch on a task card. | One rule |
| Run now | Open the card menu and select **Run now**. | One rule |
| Delete | Open the card menu and select **Delete task**. Run history is kept. | Definition only |
| Inspect runs | Open **Run history**, then filter by day, week, month, task, or status. | Host-wide |

Each dispatched run uses the saved prompt, workspace, model, and permission boundary. It does not reuse approvals from the source chat.

## Safety boundary

| Item | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Permission | Options and the default come directly from the Host `permissionPresets` service, including custom presets. |
| Tool calls | Follow Host tool availability, permission, and approval checks without an additional fixed tool allowlist or a background-shell ban. The Host manages background processes. |
| Full access | The official `danger-full-access` option uses the same risk confirmation and orange warning as Chat. |
| Approval | Chat create follows the session policy. Full access (`never`) proceeds; Workspace Write / Read Only (`ask`) shows the official card. Unattended runs stay fail-closed `never`. |
| Retry | No automatic retry after a started run. |
| Host restart | Leftover `queued` / `running` records become `failed(host_interrupted)`. |
| Overlap | One active run per rule. A colliding occurrence is recorded as `skipped(overlap)`. |

A schedule stores future intent. It is not a cached permission grant.

## Development

### Install from source

Use this for debugging or unpublished changes. The cloned directory becomes the plugin source path:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
Set-Location D:\Repository\deepseek-harness-plugin
git clone https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-automation.git
Set-Location .\dsh-automation
pnpm install
pnpm test
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. Local installation reads and applies `cordis.patch.yml`; do not copy `lib` files manually.

Current sources live in `src` and build into `lib`:

- [src\index.ts](src/index.ts): Host plugin, tools, and RPC.
- [src\service.ts](src/service.ts): Durable definitions, clock, and run admission.
- [src\client\index.ts](src/client/index.ts): Settings page and chat prefill.
- `tests\*.test.ts`: Domain, recurrence, service, client, and package-contract tests.

After changing files, run tests, rebuild, and reinstall from the local directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm check
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

Keep the at-most-once dispatch policy, workspace scoping for Agent tools, and fail-closed unattended approval when changing execution code.

## Verification

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

`pnpm check` runs typecheck, tests, and build together.
