> DSH Codex UI is a community-maintained DeepSeek Harness (DSH) plugin, not an official DeepSeek AI product. It uses public DSH slots only and does not modify host source code or conversation data.

## Features

- Replace the default sidebar through the official `sidebar` slot and keep `sidebar.workspaces`, `sidebar.settings`, and `sidebar.footer.action`.
- Provide a Codex-style header with brand wordmark, sidebar collapse, and global search.
- List workspaces and conversations with expand/collapse, drag reorder, project pinning, unread dots, and running-state indicators.
- Add project and conversation menus for rename, pin, unread, archive, fork, open folder, copy, and delete.
- Restyle the conversation column and composer card, and add a compact turn navigator on the current session.
- Show companion-plugin status in **Settings → About**, and install the missing pieces from npm.

## Screenshots

Light theme: Codex-style sidebar, workspace tree, and conversation column.

## Prerequisites

- A working DeepSeek Harness Web installation with `dsh` available in PowerShell.
- Examples use the `web` profile; replace it with the target profile.
- Source installation and development require Node.js 22+ and pnpm. Installing from npm does not require running `pnpm install` in an arbitrary directory.

## Plugin combo

`@michengai/dsh-codex-suite-installer` is the lightweight one-click installer for the `@michengai/dsh-codex-suite` member set. It adds these six plugins to the same profile as **direct dependencies**:

| Plugin | npm package | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex UI | `@michengai/dsh-codex-ui` | Codex-style sidebar, workspace tree, search, and turn navigation |
| Expert management | `@michengai/dsh-agency-agents` | Settings page opened from **Experts** |
| Skill management | `@michengai/dsh-skills-manager` | Settings page opened from **Skills** |
| Archive management | `@michengai/dsh-archive-manager` | Permanent deletion and archived-session management |
| IM Assistant | `@michengai/dsh-im-connect` | IM settings and the **Channels** tab |
| Scheduled tasks | `@michengai/dsh-automation` | Scheduled-task settings and the **Schedule** tab |

`dshmarket` stays optional. When it is installed, **Plugins** opens the market first.

Direct dependencies let **Settings → About** detect and update every plugin independently. The lightweight installer carries only the version manifest, and it migrates the legacy aggregate Suite without leaving duplicate patches behind.

## DSH product ecosystem

Codex UI can be installed independently or used through the desktop app or Web suite. They share the same DSH core but serve different ways of working:

| Product | Relationship to Codex UI |
| --- | --- |
| [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) | The host runtime that provides models, sessions, tools, and the plugin system |
| [DSH Codex Desktop](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-desktop) | A ready-to-install desktop product with Codex UI and the other five feature products built in |
| [DSH Codex Suite](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-ui/tree/main/packages/dsh-codex-suite) | A one-click suite for existing DSH Web environments that installs Codex UI and the other five feature products |
| Six feature products | [Codex UI](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-ui) · [IM Connect](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-im-connect) · [Automation](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-automation) · [Skills Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-skills-manager) · [Archive Manager](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-archive-manager) · [Agency Agents](https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-agency-agents) |

## Installation

`dsh plugin add` forwards to `pnpm add` in the profile directory. Without a version and official registry, a local mirror or minimum-release-age policy can leave you on an older build.

### Ask another agent to install the suite

Copy one of the sentences below into DSH, Codex, or WorkBuddy and let that agent install the combo into your local `web` profile.

From npm:

```text
Use the one-click installer to add all six DSH Codex Suite members as direct dependencies of my local web profile: npx --yes @michengai/dsh-codex-suite-installer@latest --profile web. Confirm its configuration check succeeds, then remind me to restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser.
```

UI only:

```text
Install the latest DSH plugin @michengai/dsh-codex-ui into my local web profile using the official npm registry: dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-codex-ui@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/. Then run dsh --profile web --dump-config, confirm codex-ui is mounted, and remind me to restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser.
```

| Product | How to use it |
| --- | --- |
| DSH | Send one of the sentences above to the current session. |
| Codex | Send one of the sentences above to Codex and let it install locally. |
| WorkBuddy | Send one of the sentences above to WorkBuddy. |

The installer needs the current `dsh` on PATH. Set `DSH_BIN` when the executable lives elsewhere.

### Install the complete suite

This is the one-click combo. Run it from any PowerShell directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
npx --yes @michengai/dsh-codex-suite-installer@latest --profile web
```

The installer reads its exact verified member versions, adds all six members as direct profile dependencies in one `dsh plugin add`, and finishes with `dsh --profile web --dump-config`. Replace `@latest` with an installer version to pin the whole set.

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. Existing members are aligned in place; a legacy `@michengai/dsh-codex-suite` aggregate dependency is removed only after all six direct members have been staged.

Use the same command with another profile name for a clean custom Web profile:

```powershell
npx --yes @michengai/dsh-codex-suite-installer@latest --profile codex
```

The installer stays in the current `DSH_HOME` and places DSH's built-in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app` before the member bundles. It neither creates a separate Home nor reinstalls the official Web package.

### Install Codex UI only

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-codex-ui@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

The plugin takes over the default sidebar through `cordis.patch.yml`. Uninstalling restores the default sidebar.

### Install from source

Use this for debugging or unpublished changes. The cloned directory becomes the plugin source path:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
Set-Location D:\Repository\deepseek-harness-plugin
git clone https://github.com/MichengAI/dsh-codex-ui.git
Set-Location .\dsh-codex-ui
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm build
dsh plugin --profile web add .
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser. Do not copy `dist` manually; local installation reads both package metadata and `cordis.patch.yml`.

## Usage

Open DSH Web. The left navigation is rendered by this plugin.

| Goal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Start a conversation | Select **New task**, or use a workspace **+** / **New conversation** action. |
| Find a conversation or setting | Use the header search field and choose a session, Settings page, or quick action. |
| Collapse the sidebar | Use the header panel button. The expand control stays on the collapsed rail. |
| Pin a workspace | Drag it into **Pinned**, or use **Pin project** in the project menu. |
| Manage a conversation | Open the conversation menu to rename, pin, mark unread, archive, fork, copy, or delete. |
| Jump between turns | Use the turn marks on the left of the current conversation. |
| Inspect connectors | Open **Settings → Connectors**. Addresses, commands, and credentials are never shown. |
| Check companion plugins | Open **Settings → About** to install or update the combo plugins. |

Deleting a workspace registration does not delete its folder or conversation records. Pinned and unread state is stored only in the current browser.

## Persistence and safety limits

| Data | Storage | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Pinned workspaces | Host profile file with a `localStorage` cache | Survives DSH restarts and Desktop tray reloads |
| Pinned conversations | `localStorage` key `dsh.session-pins.v1` | Current browser only |
| Unread conversations | `localStorage` key `dsh.session-unread.v1` | Current browser only |
| Conversation records | DSH host services | Unchanged by this plugin |

- The plugin uses only public DSH slots and services.
- It does not modify host source code or the conversation data model.
- Permanent deletion of archived conversations is provided by `@michengai/dsh-archive-manager`.
- The Connectors directory never exposes addresses, commands, or credentials.

## Secondary development

- [src\index.ts](src/index.ts): host entry and the non-sensitive Connectors directory endpoint.
- [src\client\index.ts](src/client/index.ts): client entry for sidebar, workspace tree, turn navigation, and Settings sections.
- [src\client\CodexSidebar.tsx](src/client/CodexSidebar.tsx): sidebar shell, search panel, and visual styles.
- [src\client\CodexWorkspaceBrowser.tsx](src/client/CodexWorkspaceBrowser.tsx): workspace and conversation interactions.
- `tests\*.assert.ts` and `tests\*.spec.ts`: interaction, visual, and runtime integration checks.

After changing `src`, rebuild, test, and install from the local directory:

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm build
pnpm test
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

New features should reuse existing DSH slots and public services. Do not depend on private host DOM or write conversation records.

## Verification

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
pnpm build
pnpm test
```
