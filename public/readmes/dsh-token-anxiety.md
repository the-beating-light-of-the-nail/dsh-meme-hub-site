The Token Anxiety widget tracks the cost of every task in your conversation in
real time. It runs in the band under the chat composer and shows DeepSeek
pricing status (peak/valley), per-task token usage and cost, and a one-click
analysis of where tokens were spent. It is installed as a bundle with no
additional dependencies.

**Compatibility:** this release (`0.1.1`) targets **DeepSeek Harness ≥ 0.1.1-rc.2**.
The session projection is registered with the modern API (`stateSchema` +
`wire`); on older harness builds (≤ 0.1.0-rc.7) the widget mounts but renders
without data, because those builds still expect the pre-`wire` register shape.

**Install** (from any directory; the path is absolute):

```sh
# from npm (published package)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-token-anxiety

# or from a local checkout
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-token-anxiety
```

Then restart `dsh web` and refresh the page — done.

- **Live pricing status** — peak/valley windows for your timezone, plus local time
- **Cost overview** — current cost and the projected post-hike figure in red
- **Per-task breakdown** — a sortable table of every task with its total cost and
  token usage; hover any row for details
- **Currency support** — COP / USD / CNY by default, plus ~40 more with regional
  formatting (¥, €, £, ₩…) and live FX rates
- **One-click explain** — a short, streamed analysis of why a task cost what it
  did, written in your language
- **Dark & light, English & Chinese** — follows your harness theme and locale

It is packaged as an installable bundle for DeepSeek Harness (composed through
your profile, so it survives restarts).

## Requirements

- DeepSeek Harness with a `web` profile (`dsh web`) — the bundle is composed
  through the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` list.
- Node.js 22+ (the harness's own runtime; the bundle itself adds **zero
  dependencies** — node builtins only).

## Usage

- Hover or click the widget in the composer band to open the popup.

- **Overview** — headline cost in a big hero number (current, plus the projected
  post-hike figure in red when **Projected** is on), tasks / requests / tokens,
  and the pricing table: current vs projected rates per model, with the
  projected **peak/valley** values colored **green** when cheaper than the
  current rate and **red** when more expensive.

    </tr>
  </table>

- **Tasks** — a sortable per-task table (`#` or share %). Each row shows its
  total cost; with **Projected** on, the cost column adds the projected
  **peak/valley split** on two rows. Hover a row for a details tooltip; click a
  bar to select the task and run **Explain**.

- **Currency** — pick any enabled currency (defaults COP / USD / CNY); open the
  chooser to see FX rates, add more (flags + search), or remove them.
- **Explain** — one small LLM call per task; the analysis **streams in** as it
  is generated and is written in the **conversation's language** (a tiny LLM
  call detects the ISO 639-1 code of the task's user prompt). The result is a
  compact ~60-100 word report in four labeled lines — `Wanted:` / `Happened:` /
  `Avoid:` / `Next time:` — rendered as rich text with bold accent labels.

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full review. Summary: the three HTTP
routes are POST-only, cap request bodies, validate all input, and apply the same
browser-trust fence as the harness `/api` prefix (loopback/trustedHosts Host,
same-origin Origin, `sec-fetch-site`); the explain route has an anti-abuse
throttle and hard timeouts so a stalled model can never wedge it; nothing is
written to the session log; zero runtime dependencies.

## How it works

- `cordis.patch.yml` inserts one plugin row (`token-anxiety`) into the profile.
- The node half (`index.js`) registers the `tokenAnxiety` session projection: a
  pure fold over the ROOT session log that accumulates per-turn token usage,
  cost, tool signals and waste flags. No network, no model calls.
- The same node half registers `POST /token-anxiety/explain` on the harness
  webserver (`ctx.webServer`): the widget's Explain button fetch()es it and the
  handler runs the LLM analysis. The response **streams back as NDJSON**
  (`{"delta": …}` lines) so the widget renders the answer as it is generated; a
  60s host timeout aborts stalled LLM streams (the client aborts at 70s and
  shows a visible error). The language is detected with one tiny LLM call
  returning an ISO 639-1 code. Nothing is appended to the session log, so
  sessions stay loadable.
- `POST /token-anxiety/pricing-sync` (same trust fence) fetches the official
  DeepSeek pricing page, turns it into readable text, and sends it with a strict
  JSON schema to an LLM call — no layout scraping in code. The model returns
  CNY-per-1M prices (current, peak, valley), the Beijing peak windows and the
  effective date; the host validates, converts CNY→USD at a fixed 7.0 rate, and
  writes `pricing.override.json` next to the bundle with an explicit
  schema/currency/unit shape. A restart loads the override over the embedded
  defaults (the model list derives from the active pricing, so new models
  surface automatically), and the pricing-derived `stateVersion` discards stale
  projection caches.
- The browser half (`lib/client.js`) is a hand-written client bundle registered
  through `window.__ModuleLoader__.load({ id, factory })` — no bundler, no
  minification. It reads the projection with `useProjection('tokenAnxiety')`
  and computes peak/valley status, local time and the hour strip in the browser
  from the projection's embedded pricing config.

## Install

### From npm (published package)

The package is published to the public npm registry:

```sh
npm view dsh-token-anxiety          # verify: name, version 0.1.x, MIT
```

Install it into a harness profile (this adds it to the profile's
`package.json` dependencies and its `dsh.profile.bundles` list):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-token-anxiety
```

Or install the package directly in any npm project:

```sh
npm install dsh-token-anxiety
# or pin the exact version:
npm install dsh-token-anxiety@0.1.0
```

> Note: for `dsh web` to load the widget, the **profile** must depend on the
> package and list it in `dsh.profile.bundles` — `dsh plugin --profile web add
> dsh-token-anxiety` does both automatically.

### From a local checkout

```sh
# from any directory; the path is absolute
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-token-anxiety
```

### After either install

Restart the web server (`dsh web` / however you launch it). A restart is
required because the bundle row and the client boot graph are composed at boot.

## Update after editing

The bundle is pnpm-linked into the profile, so editing files here is enough for
a HOST-half change; the client graph only picks up a changed bundle after a
restart. After changing files, restart the web server. To remove:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-token-anxiety
```

## Configuration

### Currencies

Defaults are **COP / USD / CNY**. Add or remove currencies from the chooser
(any code in the ~40-currency catalog); the enabled list persists to
`pricing.override.json` via `POST /token-anxiety/currencies` (a restart loads
it). Rates are USD-base, refreshed by the pricing sync and cached for 24 h.

### Pricing

Prices are embedded in `PRICING` (`index.js`) as the fallback and can be
refreshed from the official DeepSeek pricing page:

```sh
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3080/token-anxiety/pricing-sync -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

The route fetches the page, asks a model to extract the current and peak/valley
rates (CNY → USD at a fixed 7.0 rate; the Beijing peak windows and the
effective date are parsed too) and writes `pricing.override.json`. FX rates
(`open.er-api.com`, keyless) ride along, cached daily. A restart merges the
override over the defaults; the pricing-derived `stateVersion` discards stale
projection caches.

### Language

When the harness locale is `zh`, the whole UI renders in Chinese and the
currency defaults to CNY. It follows the harness `locale.preference` setting.

## Known limitations

- **Root-session tasks only.** The projection fold is per-session and
  synchronous, so the subagent tree the old dynamic plugin aggregated on demand
  cannot be folded here. Subagent conversations do not appear in the widget. (The
  `explain_task` tool itself aggregates the full subagent tree, so its
  conversation context is complete.)
- **Explain is a direct host route, not an agent turn.** The widget's button
  fetch()es `/token-anxiety/explain` (registered by the host half on the
  harness webserver), and the host runs the analysis LLM call inline. The
  analysis lives in the widget's component state, so it does not survive a page
  reload and it is not part of the session log (deliberately: it never writes a
  custom session event, so sessions stay loadable). The `explain_task` tool is
  kept for conversational asks ("why did this cost so much?"). The route sits
  outside the harness `/api` prefix, so it applies the same browser-trust
  predicate itself (loopback or `trustedHosts` Host, same-origin Origin,
  `sec-fetch-site`); the deployment still binds loopback-only.
- **Pricing is embedded and dated.** The embedded `PRICING` is the fallback;
  refreshing it is a host-side action (`POST /token-anxiety/pricing-sync`, see
  [Configuration](#configuration)) that writes `pricing.override.json`; a
  restart merges it over the defaults. Editing `PRICING` by hand still works;
  `stateVersion` derives from the active pricing, so any change discards
  persisted projection-cache rows.
