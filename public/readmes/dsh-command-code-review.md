> `/code-review` slash command for DeepSeek Harness — five parallel review lenses, per-finding confidence scoring, for both pull requests and local code.

`/code-review` slash command for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh) — a self-contained plugin bundle that runs a full code review, either on a pull request or on local code.

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

## What it does

Registers one global slash command with two modes:

- `/code-review <pr number|url>` — pull-request review (eligibility check → 5 parallel review lenses → per-finding confidence scoring → posts the result back to the PR with `gh`).
- `/code-review [request]` (or empty) — local review of the requested scope (empty input probes the current branch's open PR first, then reviews the uncommitted changes; an explicit whole-project request reviews the entire repository; a named file/directory/module reviews exactly that scope); reports findings directly in chat (no `gh` needed).

Both modes share the same core: collect relevant `dsh.md` guidance, launch 5 parallel review subagents (dsh.md adherence, shallow bug scan, git-history, prior-change comments, code-comment compliance), confidence-score each finding with a parallel subagent, and drop anything below the configured threshold (default 80).

## Requirements

- A dsh profile built on `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` (every shipped profile), which provides the `commands` service and the subagent/bash/todo tools the workflow uses.
- The [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com) (`gh`) on `PATH`, authenticated — required only for pull-request review. Local review needs no `gh`.

## Install

From the npm registry:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-command-code-review
```

From a local checkout or tarball:

```sh
# directory
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-command-code-review

# packed tarball
dsh plugin --profile web add /path/to/dsh-command-code-review-<version>.tgz
```

The `dsh plugin add` command installs the package into the profile and, because its `package.json` declares `dsh.bundle`, appends it to `dsh.profile.bundles` automatically. Restart or re-boot the profile to pick it up.

## Usage

Type `/code-review` in the web composer:

```
/code-review 123                                  # review a pull request by number
/code-review https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123
/code-review review src/auth                      # local review of a named scope
/code-review review the whole project             # local review of the entire repository
/code-review                                      # local review of the current uncommitted changes
```

## How it works

The package is a standard dsh **bundle**:

- `package.json` declares `"dsh": { "bundle": { "patch": "./cordis.patch.yml" } }`.
- `cordis.patch.yml` inserts one plugin row (`id: command-code-review`) into the profile layer stack.
- `lib/index.js` is a Cordis plugin that injects `commands` and registers the `code-review` command. The handler routes PR numbers/URLs to the pull-request workflow and everything else (including empty input) to the local-review workflow, then delivers it via `agent.followup`. The confidence threshold is configurable per profile (see Configuration), and the workflows tell the agent to await subagent completion notices rather than polling.

Users can disable or override the command from their own profile `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- disable: command-code-review
```

## Configuration

- **Confidence threshold**: the workflow drops findings scored below a threshold (default 80). Override it in your profile `cordis.patch.yml`:

  ```yaml
  - id: command-code-review
    config:
      threshold: 90
  ```
- **Review lenses**: the 5 parallel review lenses (dsh.md compliance, bug scan, git-history, prior-change comments, code-comment compliance) live in `lib/index.js`; add or remove lenses to fit your needs.

## Troubleshooting

- **No review comment posted**: the PR is closed, draft, trivial, or already reviewed; or no finding scored 80 or above.
- **`gh` not found**: install and authenticate the GitHub CLI (`gh auth login`); only pull-request review needs it.
- **Code links do not render**: use the full commit SHA and the `#L[start]-L[end]` line range.
