# dsh-acp-enhanced

An enhanced [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP) server for
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (dsh), built for ACP
editors like **Zed**. It is a drop-in replacement for the official `@deepseek-ai/dsh-acp`
bridge: the official bridge only streams plain text, this one exposes the Web GUI's
capabilities — streaming, telemetry, model/permission control, session management, MCP —
over the ACP wire.

## Features

### Output & telemetry

- **Block + reasoning streaming**: text blocks and the model's thinking arrive live
  (`agent_message_chunk` / `agent_thought_chunk`); cancelled/retried attempts never leak
  torn output
- **Full telemetry**: context usage ring plus cache hit rate / TPS / input-output-reasoning
  tokens / tool timing / turn counts (`usage_update._meta` carries the full breakdown)
- **Image support (multimodal)**: when the dsh composition mounts an attachment store
  (dsh 0.1.1-rc.2+ with `dsh-attachment-local`, the default in dsh-base), `promptCapabilities.image`
  is advertised and pasted/uploaded images are ingested into the harness's durable attachment
  store — a vision-capable model (e.g. `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`) reads them natively,
  in wire order with surrounding text. Older stacks (no attachment store) automatically
  downgrade: image is not advertised and an image prompt is refused with a clear error.

### Model & permissions

- **Model switching**: live `provider/model` catalog dropdown (ACP grouped-select wire shape)
- **Reasoning effort**: `reasoning_effort` dropdown — only when the routed model exposes
  selectable efforts; each model remembers the effort it last used (persisted per profile),
  so switching back restores it, and a first-time model falls back to its own default — or
  its first offered effort — instead of an empty "unknown" selection
- **Permission presets**: read-only / workspace-write / full-access session modes
- **Approval**: native allow-once / reject-once prompts per tool call
- **Agent presets**: per-session model-facing composition (tools + prompt sections)
  from the dsh agent-presets roster. `standard` is the full coding agent (default),
  `minimal` (极简模式) is a bare shell + files editor with **no** subagent/web/todo/plan
  tools — nothing from the host layer leaks into a minimal agent; `code` and `cordis`
  ship alongside, and your own presets under `~/.dsh/.agent-presets` appear too.
  Choose via the `agent_preset` config option, the `/preset` command, or the
  `DSH_ACP_PRESET` env var (per-session default); switching is only allowed while the
  session is still blank (no turn has run), so history never straddles two tool sets.

### Zed deep integration

- **Tool cards**: one-line summary in the collapsed header — `Read <path>`, the
  model's own intent line for shell commands (`description`, Codex-style — the
  exact command stays one click away), `Search: <pattern>`, `Fetch: <url>`, etc.
  The card body follows the ACP best practice: file edits render as a real
  **diff**, **bash/pwsh commands as a real terminal card** (codex-acp wire
  shape: command line + output + exit pill inside a terminal panel — no more
  raw-JSON cards), other executors as a syntax-highlighted code block, and
  touched files as **clickable locations** that open the file — with `rawInput`
  / `rawOutput` kept one click away for transparency, plus per-kind icons and a
  proper in-progress → completed/failed status lifecycle
- **Zed files & terminal**: `zed_read_text_file` / `zed_write_text_file` / `zed_terminal`
  put file edits into Zed's "edited files" area (diff + accept/reject) and commands into a
  real Zed terminal
- **Native form questions**: `ask_user_question` → `elicitation/create` form, click an
  option — or type a custom answer when none of them fit: options render with their
  descriptions, each option-backed question gets a free-text "Custom answer" field, and a
  custom answer replaces the single selection / accompanies a multi-select (same semantics
  as dsh's native question card)
- **Plan panel**: plan mode toggle → "planning" status bar in Zed

### Sessions

- **Resume & archive**: `session/load` restores past threads (full replay);
  `session/list` / `session/delete` manage the thread archive (titled, sorted by last
  activity); live title updates
- **Multi-root workspaces**: `sessionCapabilities.additionalDirectories` is advertised,
  so Zed no longer shows "this agent doesn't currently support multi-root workspaces"
  and instead passes every workspace root on `session/new` / `session/load`. All roots
  are described to the model in the system prompt and reported on `session/list`; the
  sandbox keeps the primary `cwd` as its single writable root (see Known limitations)

### Commands

- **Slash commands**: typing `/` reveals the command list (`available_commands_update`):
  `/status` shows the route and telemetry, `/model` lists or switches the model, `/preset`
  lists or switches the agent preset (listings render as monospace code blocks — readable
  at a glance), everything else (`/compact` `/goal` `/permission` `/plan`…) runs straight
  through the harness command registry — all executed **without a model turn**. Every
  user-invocable skill is advertised as a command too, so `/ask-matt`, `/code-review`,
  `/tdd`, … reach the bridge instead of being rejected by the editor, and the skill's
  instructions are injected into the message (dsh-tool-skill-style user invocation).
  Images pasted next to a slash line ride along as command attachments (e.g. reference
  screenshots for a `/goal` objective), the same way the Web composer submits them

### MCP

- **MCP servers**: `session/new` `mcpServers` mount any MCP server (stdio + streamable
  HTTP); tools join as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`; a failing server never takes the session
  down

## Quick start

This package follows the official dsh plugin conventions (it declares `dsh.bundle`), so
installation matches any official bundle: **one command** — auto-initializes the profile,
installs the package, appends the bundle layer; no profile YAML to write.

### Install (2 steps)

**Step 1 — install** (from the npm registry; no source checkout needed):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile acp-enhanced add dsh-acp-enhanced
```

> When hacking on the code, use `link:` to a local checkout instead (live edits):
> `dsh plugin --profile acp-enhanced add "link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-acp-enhanced"`

**Step 2 — register in Zed** (under `agent_servers` in `~/.config/zed/settings.json`;
Zed spawns agents with a minimal PATH, so use the shipped launcher
`scripts/dsh-acp-zed.sh`, which locates `node`/`dsh` itself)

> **The launcher ships with the package.** Its absolute path depends on how you
> installed in Step 1:
> - **npm install (default)**: `$HOME/.dsh/profiles/acp-enhanced/node_modules/dsh-acp-enhanced/scripts/dsh-acp-zed.sh` — replace `$HOME` with your home directory (e.g. `/Users/you`); Zed does not expand `~` or env vars, so write the full literal path.
> - **`link:` dev install**: `<your checkout>/scripts/dsh-acp-zed.sh`.

#### Most common: DeepSeek official API (the default route)

```jsonc
{
  // ...your existing settings...
  "agent_servers": {
    "dsh-acp-enhanced": {
      "type": "custom",
      "command": "/bin/bash",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/dsh-acp-enhanced/scripts/dsh-acp-zed.sh"],
      "env": {
        "DSH_ACP_PROVIDER": "deepseek-official",  // the official provider id
        "DSH_ACP_MODEL": "deepseek-v4-flash",     // the official model id
        "DSH_ACP_PRESET": "standard"              // optional: agent preset id (minimal / standard / code / cordis / yours)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> Both env vars match the shipped patch's defaults, so **they can be omitted entirely** —
> writing them out just makes the route explicit. `DSH_ACP_PRESET` defaults to `standard`
> on the roster side; set it when you want every new session to start in a specific mode.
> The API key does not have to live in Zed:
> store it in `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`) and the dsh credentials
> service resolves it; the launcher also falls back to a running `dsh web` process's key.

Optional: pin the panel's default config options (all still changeable in the panel):

```jsonc
"dsh-acp-enhanced": {
  // ...the type/command/args/env above...
  "default_config_options": {
    "model": "deepseek-official/deepseek-v4-flash",
    "agent_preset": "standard",
    "plan_mode": false,
    "reasoning_effort": "high"
  },
  "favorite_config_option_values": {
    "model": ["deepseek-official/deepseek-v4-flash", "deepseek-official/deepseek-v4-pro"]
  }
}
```

#### Extended: route through an OpenAI-Responses gateway (e.g. a company model gateway)

Same install path; only the env values change to the provider/model the gateway exposes
plus the key env var it requires:

```jsonc
"dsh-acp-enhanced": {
  "type": "custom",
  "command": "/bin/bash",
  "args": ["/absolute/path/to/dsh-acp-enhanced/scripts/dsh-acp-zed.sh"],
  "env": {
    "DSH_ACP_PROVIDER": "<gateway-provider-id>",  // provider id exposed by the gateway
    "DSH_ACP_MODEL": "<gateway-model-id>",         // model id exposed by the gateway
    "<KEY_ENV_NAME>": "<key>"                      // the key env var the gateway reads
  }
}
```

> `<KEY_ENV_NAME>` can also be omitted and the key stored in
> `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml` instead.

Zed hot-reloads settings. Open the **AI Agent panel** (`Cmd+Shift+A`) → pick
**dsh-acp-enhanced** in the agent selector → send your first message: replies stream in
real time, the status bar shows context usage, the panel exposes Model / Permission preset
/ Plan mode options plus three modes, and the thread archive lists and resumes past
sessions.

Verify locally (no Zed needed):

```sh
node scripts/acp-client.mjs                    # official default route, no env; expect ALL CHECKS PASSED
DSH_ACP_PROVIDER=... DSH_ACP_MODEL=... node scripts/acp-client.mjs   # only for a custom route
```

### Web search

The bridge ships no search provider and takes no position on which one you use: the
model-facing `web_search` tool rides on the `web` seam's `searchProvider`, so mount any
`ctx.web` provider into the profile — a package with `dsh.bundle` via
`dsh plugin --profile acp-enhanced add <package>`, or a plain package via your user-layer
`insert` rows (see below). Which provider exists in your dsh deployment is a profile
concern, not a bridge one.

### Managing the profile's plugins

dsh-acp-enhanced runs in its **own profile** — `acp-enhanced`, created at
`~/.dsh/profiles/acp-enhanced/` by the install command above — fully separate from the
`web` profile behind `dsh web`, so plugin changes here never affect your web setup.

The profile composes its plugin tree from three sources, each layer patching the ones
before it:

1. **Bundle layers** — `dsh.profile.bundles` in the profile's `package.json`: the
   template's `@deepseek-ai/dsh-base` first, then every installed package that declares
   `dsh.bundle` (like `dsh-acp-enhanced`), in array order.
2. **Your user layer** — `~/.dsh/profiles/acp-enhanced/cordis.patch.yml`: id-targeted
   row config overrides, `disabled: true` row disables, and `insert` lists (how a
   package without `dsh.bundle` — e.g. a hand-mounted custom provider — gets
   mounted).
3. **Per-run overlays** — `dsh --profile acp-enhanced --patch extra.yml`.

Adjust the set with:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile acp-enhanced add <package>     # install; a dsh.bundle package auto-joins the layer stack
dsh plugin --profile acp-enhanced remove <package>  # uninstall; auto-leaves the stack
dsh plugin --profile acp-enhanced update [package]  # update one/all, then reconcile
dsh --profile acp-enhanced --dump-config             # inspect the composed tree (per-layer provenance)
```

`dsh plugin` is a thin pnpm forwarder (run inside the profile directory) that
reconciles `dsh.profile.bundles` against the installed state after every run. Two
consequences worth knowing:

- **Disabling a bundle by deleting it from `bundles` does not stick** — the package is
  still an installed dependency, and the next `dsh plugin` run appends it right back.
  To disable a single row without uninstalling, target it in the user layer by its
  **row id** (not the package name — find ids in the `--dump-config` output):

  ```yaml
  - id: mnemon
    disabled: true
  ```

- **A package without `dsh.bundle` loads nothing by itself** — it installs as a plain
  dependency (with a one-time warning) and needs your own `insert` entry in the user
  layer. To change an existing row's config, override it with `- id: <row>` + `config:`
  — patch entries replace the whole row config, they do not merge.

Changes take effect in the **next** process: Zed spawns a fresh
`dsh --profile acp-enhanced` for every agent thread, so open a new agent thread (or
restart Zed) after editing the profile.

## Compatibility

One bridge binary runs against every harness generation from **0.1.0-rc.6** through
**0.1.2-rc.1**. The 0.1.2 line rewrote three APIs this bridge consumes, and the
bridge absorbs every generation at runtime — no fork, no version flag:

| API | ≤ 0.1.1-rc.2 (legacy) | ≥ 0.1.2-alpha.2 (projection) | Bridge behavior |
|---|---|---|---|
| running preset of a session | `resolveSessionPreset({header, events})` export | export removed; `agentPreset` session projection | folds the log itself (last `agent-preset/selected` wins, header fallback) — identical semantics in both |
| preset resolution failure | `UnknownPresetError` / `PresetMountError` | `RemoteError`, codes `agent-preset/*` | `isPresetClientError`: RemoteError duck-typed by `isDSHRemoteError` + `code`, legacy classes identified structurally by `presetId` (never cross-copy `instanceof`) |
| `permissionPresets.current(x)` | `current(events)` | `current(session)` (via `permissionState`) | `currentPermissionMode` probes the service instance per call |
| session event log reads | synchronous `session.events` array | `session.events` removed (0.1.2-rc.1); `snapshotEvents()` / `ownEvents()` / `eventAt()` | `sessionEventsOf` reads `snapshotEvents()` when present, the live array otherwise |
| registry `execute` signature | `execute(agent, line, signal)` | `execute(agent, line, images, signal)` (images between line and signal, 0.1.1-rc.1+) | `executeRegistryCommand` probes the declared arity (the `Remote` decorator never wraps the method) |
| `userQuestions` registration | `registerProvider({ask})` | `user-questions/request` Cordis waterfall (0.1.2-alpha.2+) | probes the service instance; waterfall listener answers bridge-owned requests and delegates via `next()` |

Two invariants make this safe (same conclusions the openma `deepseek-harness-acp` adapter
reached independently): **value-import pure helpers only** (`createUserMessage`,
`ReasoningEffortId`, `SessionId`, `defineTool`, … — a foreign copy is functionally
equivalent), and **service-generation questions are answered by probing the service
instance**, because the booting CLI — not this package's dependency range — decides the
service generation. `dsh-agent-presets` is imported as a *namespace*: 0.1.2-alpha.1
removed its named exports, and a named import would fail at ESM link time.

Check both generations from a clean tree:

```sh
node scripts/compat-check.mjs   # installs 0.1.0-rc.6 + 0.1.2-alpha.2+ sets, imports the bridge from each
```

### Dev checkout: repo-pinned CLI, isolated home

When the launcher runs **from a checkout** (`link:` install), it resolves the dsh CLI in
this order:

1. `$DSH_PATH` — an explicit dsh binary, or a directory whose `node_modules/.bin/dsh` holds one
2. the repo-pinned CLI — `<repo>/node_modules/.bin/dsh` (this package's `@deepseek-ai/dsh`
   devDependency, currently 0.1.2-rc.1)
3. global fallback — `dsh` on PATH / npx cache / npm prefix (the legacy behavior; a fresh
   clone without `pnpm install` degrades to it)

Whenever (1) or (2) wins, the profile boots under an **isolated home**
(`DSH_ACP_HOME`, default `~/.dsh-acp`): dsh heals its whole dependency closure into
`$DSH_HOME/profiles/node_modules` on every boot — a dir shared by every profile under that
home whose content flips to whichever CLI booted last — so a second CLI generation must not
share a home with e.g. a running `dsh web`. The default home is never touched by this path.
Harness-injected `DSH_HOME=$HOME/.dsh` in the child environment (dsh exports it into every
agent/tool process) is detected and overridden, not honored — only a `DSH_HOME` pointing
away from the default home is respected; to force the pinned CLI onto the default home,
set `DSH_ACP_HOME=$HOME/.dsh` deliberately.

Bootstrap the isolated home once (profile without `dsh-mnemon` — it does not support the
0.1.2-alpha harness — plus your old profile's user rows ported verbatim and credentials/settings
migration, the `subagent-model-selection-settings` host service the 0.1.2-alpha `standard`
preset requires, and the DeepSeek plugin-package inventory reporter disabled):

```sh
scripts/init-acp-home.sh            # idempotent; re-runs never clobber your files
```

Both harness generations persist sessions under `$DSH_HOME/sessions/<slug>/<id>/session.jsonl.zstd`, and the new generation reads old-generation logs (verified: history replay and the preset fold work cross-generation). Old threads therefore only need their session history copied to the new home — `scripts/init-acp-home.sh` prints the one-liner (or pass `--copy-sessions`); it copies nothing by default, because the default home's tree also holds every web-profile session.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| `exec: dsh: not found` (status 127) | Use the shipped `dsh-acp-zed.sh` launcher (locates node/dsh itself) |
| `no API key for provider route "xxx"` | Write `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml`, or set `env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` on the agent_servers entry |
| `SyntaxError: ... 'PresetMountError'` | You are running a pre-0.7.0 bridge copy against a 0.1.2-alpha host — update this package |
| `modelSelectionSettings requires ... in the Host scope` | A 0.1.2-alpha host without the `subagent-model-selection-settings` row — run `scripts/init-acp-home.sh` (or add the insert row to your user layer, see the script) |
| Old threads start empty after a host upgrade | The sessions live under `$DSH_HOME/sessions/<slug>/`; copy the old home's history to the isolated home (`scripts/init-acp-home.sh --copy-sessions`) and the new host resumes them |
| Cannot switch models | The saved `reasoning_effort` default (or the session's current effort) is carried onto the new model. Since 0.3.6 the bridge remembers the last effort per model (per-profile JSON): an unsupported carried effort is replaced by that model's remembered effort, else its own default, else its first offered effort — never an "unknown" dropdown, never a failed switch. Also check: a "phantom provider" route was picked — this bridge filters them by default (only `config.provider`'s models are advertised), so point the profile's provider at a real route |
| Context usage missing | A "phantom provider" route was picked; this bridge filters them by default (only `config.provider`'s models are advertised) — point the profile's provider at a real route |
| Need detailed diagnostics | `ACP_DEBUG=1 dsh --profile acp-enhanced` (stderr lifecycle trace) |

## Development

```sh
node scripts/compat-check.mjs         # cross-generation link check (0.1.0-rc.6 + 0.1.2-alpha.2+ scratch installs)
node scripts/acp-client.mjs           # end-to-end smoke (needs an API key)
node scripts/acp-client-tools.mjs     # client-tool tests (mocks Zed fs/terminal/elicitation/plan)
node scripts/acp-mcp-test.mjs         # MCP mount test (no model calls)
node scripts/acp-smoke-keyless.mjs    # keyless boot smoke (CI)
node scripts/acp-resume-test.mjs      # session resume test
node scripts/codec-image-test.mjs     # image-codec unit tests (no network, fake store)
node scripts/terminal-codec-test.mjs   # terminal-card codec unit tests (no network)
node scripts/acp-image-e2e.mjs        # image capability e2e (vision-model leg needs an API key)
scripts/init-acp-home.sh              # bootstrap/refresh the isolated home (~/.dsh-acp)
```

DevDependency pins for the harness packages use the same ranges the pinned
`@deepseek-ai/dsh` CLI declares (e.g. `^0.1.2-rc.1`), so the repo's tree and a fresh
CLI install resolve one coherent family — exact patch pins here mixed with the CLI's
range-resolved closure produce a split closure (two versions of one name) that breaks
profile boots with export-not-found errors. After changing those pins, regenerate the
whole lockfile (`rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml && pnpm install`): an incremental
install both leaves stale store entries poisoning the profile heal AND retains stale
lockfile peer resolutions — bumping 0.1.2-alpha.2 → 0.1.2-rc.1 in place left
`dsh-session-persistence@0.1.2-alpha.3` (old-generation peers) wired into the rc.1
packages' snapshots, which passes boot and session/new and only breaks the first turn
with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` from
PersistenceCoordinator.
`pnpm-workspace.yaml` approves the CLI closure's build scripts (node-pty prebuilds, koffi)
— they are runtime requirements when the repo CLI boots the profile.

## Known limitations

Audio attachments are not supported (audio capability is not advertised), text streams at
block granularity, one in-flight prompt per session. MCP supports stdio and streamable HTTP
(legacy SSE / `acp` transports are not advertised).
`session/close` / `session/fork` / `session/resume` are not implemented (capabilities
undeclared, compliant clients will not call them); `session/delete` removes the
persisted directory directly because dsh persistence has no official delete API.

Multi-root workspaces are advertised and all roots are visible to the model, but dsh's
sandbox policy resolves **one writable root per session** (the primary `cwd`, i.e.
`session.header.cwd`) and the local sandboxes bind exactly that root for writes. Reads
work in every root; under `workspace-write` a write under an additional root is denied
first and needs escalation/approval, while `danger-full-access` writes everywhere.
True multi-root write enforcement belongs in dsh core (`dsh-sandbox-policy` /
`dsh-sandbox-local` would need a root list instead of a single root).

Agent presets take over the model-facing rows: the shipped `cordis.patch.yml` disables
the dsh-base rows a preset owns (tool-bash/fs/subagent/todo/web/… — exactly the official
dsh-web-app/tui list minus `hmr`) and mounts the `agent-presets` roster (`standard`
default; `code`/`minimal`/`cordis` ship with the dsh CLI, your own preset dirs under
`~/.dsh/.agent-presets` are picked up automatically). The bundle's own patch applies
automatically (package.json `dsh.bundle.patch`) — do **not** copy it into the profile's
user-layer `cordis.patch.yml`, or the loader rejects the duplicate entry ids at boot.
When **upgrading** a profile that already carries a customized user-layer patch, keep
only your custom row configs there (e.g. `includeAllProviders: true` on the
acp-enhanced row, restating provider/model/preset since patch entries replace whole
rows, they do not merge). A session created before the upgrade resumes under the
roster's default preset.
