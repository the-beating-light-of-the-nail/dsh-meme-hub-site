## Overview

Patchouli exposes one `update` / `retrieve` / `subscribe` service inside
[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness). Connectors
provide trusted runtime data, memory and knowledge plugins own their algorithms,
and an independent Rust backend provides durable transactional storage.

DeepSeek Harness is the first supported integration. The database backend
remains harness-neutral.

## Features

- Common Memory Service with provider filters, user routing policies, and provenance.
- Consumer-side aggregation that keeps native plugin results intact.
- Incremental retrieval streams with backpressure and a final `complete` aggregate.
- Agent Loop connector with configurable hooks and model tools.
- Pluggable local or remote memory and knowledge implementations.
- Managed image and workspace-file ingestion as typed Artifacts.
- Durable subscriptions and a transactional Rust backend with SQLite and remote providers.

## Plugin compatibility

`Official` means the upstream plugin registers the `patchouli` service directly.
`Patch` means GOOJFC adapts one exact plugin version through
[dsh-harmony](https://github.com/memorax-ai/dsh-harmony). The table distinguishes
upstream integrations from version-pinned patches.

## Install and use

Requires Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24`, pnpm 11, and a DeepSeek Harness runtime
compatible with `0.1.0-rc.6`:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-patchouli
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

The plugin includes `patchouli-db` as a dependency. On first use it downloads
the matching, checksum-verified daemon binary from the same-version GitHub
release and initializes the default local database home. The bundled DSH profile
enables its storage client by default; it connects to the local daemon and starts
it when needed. The last command
should list `patchouli`, `patchouli-storage`, and the connector plugins.
Register at least one compatible memory or knowledge plugin to handle routed
`update`, `retrieve`, and `subscribe` calls.

See the [Getting started guide](https://memorax-ai.github.io/dsh-patchouli/getting-started)
for configuration and platform-specific details.

## What does the plugin's name mean???

The name refers directly to
[Patchouli Knowledge](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Patchouli_Knowledge), and
also pays tribute to the widely known Minecraft mod
[Patchouli](https://github.com/VazkiiMods/Patchouli).
