Add a WSL workspace from the DeepSeek Harness web GUI and run the whole agent session — bash commands and file reads/writes — inside a local WSL distribution with Linux paths. Nothing needs to be installed inside WSL. The session can reach both WSL and Windows at the same time: bash commands run inside the WSL distribution, while Windows files stay accessible via `/mnt/<drive>` (for example `/mnt/c/Users/...`).

## Install

Pick one of the three ways below, then restart `dsh web`:

```powershell
# 1) npm package
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-wsl-workspace

# 2) GitHub repository (ships the prebuilt lib/, no local build required)
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/6Mikao9/dsh-wsl-workspace

# 3) Local directory (development / self-hosted)
dsh plugin --profile web add D:\path\to\dsh-wsl-workspace
```

After restarting `dsh web`, a W button appears beside Settings at the sidebar foot.

## Usage

Click the W button beside Settings at the sidebar foot to open the "Add WSL workspace" dialog. Pick a distribution from the list, then browse the directory tree or type an absolute Linux path (for example `/home/me/proj`) — use the Check button to verify the path exists before creating the workspace. The dialog follows the DeepSeek Harness UI language. The username field is optional: leave it empty to run commands as the distribution's default user, or name a Linux user of that distribution to run the session as that user instead (equivalent to `wsl.exe -u <username>`). The username only changes the bash tool's run identity — the file tools go through the Windows-side WSL share and are unaffected. Each workspace's username is kept in `<dshHome>/wsl-workspaces.json`; delete the entry (or recreate the workspace from the dialog) to return to the default user.

Click "Create & open" to start a new session in the workspace. In the new session the bash tool executes commands inside the chosen distribution and `read`/`write`/`edit` operate on WSL files, so every path the model sees is a Linux path. The mode picker keeps working as usual: Standard, PTC, Minimal and Creative each land on their WSL variant automatically (the WSL variant entries in the picker are bilingual, e.g. `WSL · Standard mode（标准模式）`), and Windows files stay reachable from inside the session under `/mnt/<drive>` (for example `/mnt/c/Users/...`).

## Behavior notes

- **bash tool**: runs inside the WSL distribution as the configured username (empty = the distro default user, often `root`), so it can read and write anywhere in the distro. The Windows ACL sandbox cannot wrap `wsl.exe` — its children run on the Linux kernel side — so WSL itself is the isolation boundary and the DSH file policy does not apply to bash.
- **File tools (`read`/`write`/`edit`)**: go through the Windows-side WSL 9P share and run under the DSH file policy. Under `workspace-write`, reads work anywhere but writes are restricted to the session workspace; switch the file policy to `danger-full-access` to also allow writes outside it. The username field does not affect the file tools.
- **Skill catalog**: the session's skill catalog is discovered starting at the session cwd's nearest `.git` ancestor (falling back to the cwd itself), then scanning downward for `.dsh/skills` / `.agents/skills` — including nested projects — bounded to 4 directory levels, 64 skill directories and 4096 visited directories. Register the workspace at the project root you work in; if the registered workspace itself sits inside a larger git repository, the scan starts at that repository's root (matching the host's own rule) and sibling projects may surface. Results are cached per scan root and served stale-while-revalidate: a fresh scan (the first lookup, and a background refresh every 10 seconds) may take a moment on very large trees — a workspace registered at the distro root `/` scans the whole filesystem — but repeated lookups always answer instantly and never block on a refresh. Skill bodies always load live. One substrate limit to know: the Windows-side `\\wsl.localhost` share cannot resolve Linux symlinks (they read back as unresolvable entries), so a project linked into the workspace via `ln -s` is not discoverable — the scan walks past it without failing; register the workspace at a level that contains the real project directories instead.
- The garbled `localhost` port-forwarding banner `wsl.exe` prints to stderr when the distro was not running yet is harmless.

## Changelog

### 0.4.0 — 2026-08-29

Follow-ups from the [#12](https://github.com/6Mikao9/dsh-wsl-workspace/issues/12) limitation list and the [#13](https://github.com/6Mikao9/dsh-wsl-workspace/issues/13) compatibility work:

- **Lookup cache**: completed skill-catalog lookups are cached per scan root and served **stale-while-revalidate** — the first scan of a workspace is real (seconds on large trees), every later lookup answers instantly, an expired entry never blocks (it is served immediately while a background refresh runs, so even a workspace registered at the distro root stays responsive), and `get()` keeps reading skill bodies live.
- **Boundary hardening**: UNC spellings with double separators, trailing slashes, uppercase hosts, the legacy `\\wsl$` form and distro-root cwds all parse and scan correctly; skill files saved as UTF-8 with a BOM or with CRLF line endings (including CRLF block scalars) now parse; unreadable directories prune without failing the scan; a name+description+body fingerprint guarantees aliased skill files never publish twice.
- **Symlinked projects — investigated, substrate-limited**: the discovery walk now recognizes directory symlinks explicitly and prunes them safely (no crashes, no loops). Following them is not possible over the `\\wsl.localhost` 9P share — the Windows side cannot resolve Linux symlink targets (probed: `readlink` → `EISDIR`, `stat`/`readdir` → `ENOENT`) — so a project linked into the workspace via `ln -s` stays undiscoverable; a name+body fingerprint dedupe also guarantees aliased skill files can never publish twice on substrates that do resolve links.
- **Block-scalar frontmatter**: `description:` / `whenToUse:` written as YAML block scalars (`|` literal, `>` folded) now parse — such skills were silently dropped before.
- **Compatibility manifest**: `dsh.compatibility.dshReleases` declares per-release compatibility with the official DSH versions, backed by reproducible disposable-Profile install/start/uninstall evidence (`scripts/verify-dsh-compat.sh`), and `engines` declares the Node.js floor.
- **Guard scripts**: `scripts/check-rank-parity.mjs` fails the release when the copied project-rank constants drift from the host's `dsh-skill-filesystem`.

### 0.3.2 — 2026-08-29

- **WSL workspace sessions now inject nested-project skill catalogs** ([#10](https://github.com/6Mikao9/dsh-wsl-workspace/issues/10)): `.dsh/skills` and `.agents/skills` directories of projects nested below the registered workspace root are discovered and published with the host's project ranks and sources, so the model sees the same skill catalog it would see when the session cwd is the project folder itself. Discovery is depth- and budget-bounded, prunes `node_modules`/dot-directories, and leaves non-WSL sessions untouched.
- **Host-parity scan root**: lookups from inside a project subtree resolve the nearest `.git` ancestor first, so the enclosing project's skills stay visible from deeper cwds; skills above that ancestor do not leak.
- **Hardening**: the skill-root budget is enforced per push, and the `skills.registerProvider` call is guarded so a host whose `skills` service has a different shape can no longer break plugin load.
- **Housekeeping**: removed stale prebuilt `lib/` chunks that shipped dead vendor code (including an inlined schemastery copy that triggered dsh.so's `new Function` static rule); added `scripts/repro-setup.sh` plus a nested skill-catalog regression suite, and a matching TESTING.md section.
