## Why this exists

DSH moves fast, and so does its plugin ecosystem. Every profile installs plugins through pnpm specs — npm versions, GitHub commit pins, local `link:` checkouts — and each channel drifts out of date in its own way. Checking them by hand means walking every repo; auto-updating everything blindly means trusting third-party code with your environment.

This plugin takes the middle path: **detect everything, summarize what changed, update only what you trigger.** Updates are one click — no confirmation ceremony between you and the button — and target only the eligible profiles shown for that package. The DSH core is deliberately *report-only* — upgrading the harness restarts every session, so that decision stays with a human.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🔭 **Full radar** | dsh core + shipped bundles (`dsh-base`, `dsh-web-app`) + every profile's plugin dependencies, in one scan |
| 🔄 **Dual channel** | npm registry versions (full semver compare, prerelease-aware) and git upstreams (pinned-commit vs HEAD, `link:` checkouts via read-only `ls-remote`) |
| 🧭 **Update highlights** | Per-item: semver distance, risk level (major → high, minor → medium, patch → low), changelog material — npm versions between yours and latest, GitHub compare commits, release notes (with their body rendered inline), or local `git log`; every artifact links out (npm version pages, commits, releases, compare views) and every row carries a ↗ to its repository — monorepo sub-packages link to their subdirectory, npm plugins without a resolvable GitHub repository fall back to their npm package page |
| 🤖 **Agent tools** | `update_copilot_scan` / `update_copilot_brief` / `update_copilot_update` — ask your agent *"any updates?"* and get an honest, data-backed answer. Scans are package-centric (one row per package, merged across profiles); inferred mount relationships are presentation-only, while official packages are report-only and each direct dependency keeps its own update policy. `profile` is optional on brief/update: without it, a brief covers every eligible profile that has the package, and an update runs only across those eligible profiles |
| 🖥 **Web surfaces** | A sidebar trigger beside Settings (its badge hydrates on mount and refreshes after the startup scan; the badge can be turned off in settings for a quiet sidebar) opens a compact popup, and a **⚡ Update all** quick button sits right beside it — no view needed: one click runs every outdated auto-updatable plugin in sequence (running shows an `n/m` readout and disables, completion flashes ✓/✗, failures or restart-required open the popup with details). Popup and full page share one folded layout — the **DeepSeek Harness core** card starts collapsed, and plugins split into an "Updates available" section plus a folded "Up to date" section (expand on click), inferred mount relationships staying with their parent. The full page lives on in Settings → Update Copilot, which also offers an opt-in **Refresh every 30 minutes** toggle (off by default — upstreams are only queried at startup and on your actions; when enabled, a forced background refresh runs every 30 minutes and the badge and open radar views follow along). Plugins are merged across profiles into one row per package, each installed profile's current → latest listed inline; mounted packages expand beneath their parent for disclosure while keeping independent ownership and update actions — a child **Update** targets only that child, a parent **Update** only the parent, and **Update bundle** updates only outdated eligible targets (outdated parent first, then outdated mounted children within each relationship's profile scope). One click on **Update** updates the package across its explicit eligible profiles, and a toolbar **Update all** runs every eligible outdated package in sequence (tick **Auto-update on button click** in Settings → Update Copilot and a click on the sidebar trigger starts that same pass automatically whenever outdated plugins are found; the dsh core stays report-only). All mutation actions share one UI operation lock; refresh is disabled until updates and refresh state settle. Updates stream live progress over SSE (resolving / downloading / retrying / stash / pull / restore phases) straight into a per-row progress bar. **Updates are never silent** — whoever started one (the auto-run, the agent tools, another tab), the sidebar badge turns into a pulsing *updating* dot and the popup/panel keep a live "Updating: \<package>" banner across every seat, with update buttons disabled while one is running; whoever started the update, the matching row also renders the same live progress bar inline (the initiating row via its own SSE stream, every other seat mirrored from the 2-second status poll), and a new round for that package clears the row's stale previous result — a background update never collides with a foreground click into the confusing "another update is already running" error |
| 🛡 **Update guardrails** | Same-origin POST + explicit `confirm`, strict target allowlist, single-flight lock, 5-minute timeout; npm/github specs run only through the official `dsh plugin` CLI, `link:` checkouts update via git pull in their own directory (auto-stash → pull → restore; conflicts are always handed back for manual handling), while `file:` installs and official `@deepseek-ai/*` packages remain refused |
| 🧯 **Host export check** | Scans third-party plugins' named imports of `@deepseek-ai/*` against the current DSH host packages (and the target version when the core is behind). Peer ranges miss "range still matches, export is gone" — that class of error fails the whole plugin tree at boot. The core card and plugin rows surface the finding with a copy-pasteable `cordis.patch.yml` disable snippet and `dsh plugin remove` command. When DSH itself will not start, run `node …/dsh-update-copilot/lib/cli.js` (it does not boot a profile). |
| 🌐 **Fully bilingual** | Every user-facing string — panel, popup, badges, update highlights, recommendations, update errors — follows the UI language (zh/en); the agent tool path keeps stable English identifiers |

## Install

```sh
# from npm (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-update-copilot

# or straight from the GitHub repo
dsh plugin --profile web add github:hezhongtang/dsh-update-copilot
```

Restart `dsh web`, then open **Settings → Update Copilot**. Works the same in any other profile (`--profile <name>`).

## Usage

### Ask your agent

> "check for updates"

The agent runs `update_copilot_scan`, then builds a brief for each outdated item and presents the risk before doing anything. Updates run only after you say yes — the update tool rejects calls without `confirm: true`.

### Or use the popup / panel

The **sidebar button beside Settings** opens the compact radar popup (ESC or backdrop click closes; `?duc=1` in the URL opens it once — handy for screenshots and tests). The **⚡ Update all** button right beside it runs the whole pass without opening anything: sequential updates for every outdated auto-updatable plugin, an `n/m` readout while running, ✓/✗ flash on completion, and the popup opening automatically when something failed or a restart is required. With **Auto-update on button click** enabled in Settings → Update Copilot, that same click also kicks off "Update all" the moment outdated plugins show up, with progress streaming right inside the popup.

**Updates are visible from anywhere.** Whoever started one — the sidebar auto-run, a row's Update button, the agent tool (`update_copilot_update`), another browser tab — while it is running the sidebar badge becomes a pulsing dot (tooltip names the package) when the popup is closed, and the popup/panel keep a live "Updating: \<package> (\<profile>)…" banner on top that follows the server-side stage (resolving / downloading / retrying / stash / pull / restore) and percentage. While the banner is up, every mutation action — per-row Update, the link→remote switch, **Update bundle**, toolbar Update all — is disabled, so a background update and a foreground click never fight over the single-flight lock and surface the "another update is already running" error. Sequential passes (**Update all**, **Update bundle**) render their queue inline: the executing row shows "Updating…" with a live progress bar, rows not reached yet flip their button to **"Queued"** (tooltip: it starts automatically when the current item finishes), and rows already attempted keep the regular disabled button so a stale "Update available" never reads as "not started"; when the pass finishes, the list refreshes itself to the new versions.

**Settings → Update Copilot** is the full page: core status (with a copyable upgrade command — never executed), every installed plugin merged across profiles into one row per package (each profile's current → latest listed inline), expandable mount relationships, inline update highlights, and a **one-click Update** button per row. A child row's **Update** affects only that child; a parent row's normal **Update** affects only that parent. **Update bundle** skips current targets, runs the outdated parent first when eligible, then each outdated selected mounted child in its relationship's profile scope, and reports progress/results. Each package carries explicit eligible profiles, so it never updates every same-named install blindly. A toolbar **Update all** button remains the separate global action, running every eligible outdated package in sequence. Live SSE progress drives a per-row progress bar. After an update, a plugin in the running profile is **hot-reloaded in place** when its entry and bundle patch are unchanged; the restart banner is only shown for updates outside the phase-1 hot-reload scope (bundle-patch changes, non-current profiles, self-update, etc.).

### Agent tool reference

| Tool | Read/Write | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `update_copilot_scan` | read | Full scan across core + all profiles, merged package-centric (10-min cache, `force` to bypass) |
| `update_copilot_brief` | read | Semver distance, risk, changelog material, recommendation for one package; optional `profile` restricts the brief to one profile, otherwise every profile that has the package contributes |
| `update_copilot_update` | write | Execute one **confirmed** update — without a `profile`, across its explicit eligible profiles only; npm/github specs through the official `dsh plugin` CLI (transient failures retry automatically — up to 3 attempts with jittered exponential backoff; deterministic errors like a missing version or refused auth fail fast); `link:` checkouts via git pull inside their own directory (auto-stash → pull → restore, conflicts handed back for manual handling), or with `source: "remote"` switch the dependency to the published npm version (or a `github:` spec when the package is not on npm) — breaking the local link |

## How it works

Every dependency spec is classified into a channel, and each channel has its own comparison. Scans merge the profiles' plugin lists package-centric: the same package installed in `web`, `headless`, and `desktop` appears once, carrying each profile's channel and versions. Within each profile, an active bundle whose contained patch mounts at least two production dependencies exposes presentation-only mount relationships; overlapping parents choose the largest verified child set, then package name. Mounting does not transfer update ownership: each direct dependency keeps its own update policy, and bundle updates use the selected relationship's profile scope. Local `link:` and `file:` dependencies stay local, and official `@deepseek-ai/*` packages remain report-only.

**What counts as a plugin row:** the packages a profile's manifest declares under `dsh.profile.bundles` (the list the host actually loads), plus every `link:` / `file:` checkout, which stays visible even before it is activated, plus the verified patch-mounted children of active bundles — their insert records are how the host loads those. Other plain dependencies in the manifest — a CLI or server runtime someone added for convenience — are not dsh plugins and don't render as one; that used to put a ghost update button beside the real plugin sharing the same GitHub repo. A manifest without a bundle list falls back to showing every dependency.

| Channel | Example spec | Current | Latest |
|---|---|---|---|
| npm | `^0.1.4` | installed `package.json` version | newest version in the full registry doc |
| github | `github:owner/repo#sha` | pinned commit in `pnpm-lock.yaml` | upstream HEAD via GitHub API |
| linked | `link:../my-plugin` | local `git rev-parse HEAD` | `git ls-remote origin HEAD` (read-only) |

The npm channel deliberately ignores the `latest` dist-tag: monorepo sub-packages often leave that tag stale, which false-flags installs that are actually *newer* than the tag. Versions are compared with full semver precedence (prereleases included), so `0.1.0-rc.6 > 0.1.0-rc.5` and `1.0.0 > 1.0.0-rc.1` both hold.

Updates execute through two vetted paths, never a raw shell string: npm/github specs run `dsh plugin --profile <p> add <target>` — the same path a human would type — with the target string validated against an allowlist; `link:` checkouts run git directly in their directory (`git stash push` for local changes → `git pull` → `git stash pop` to restore them). Transient failures are retried automatically: up to 3 total attempts, spaced by full-jitter exponential backoff (1s base, 8s cap) so a batch of updates doesn't re-hammer the registry in lockstep; deterministic failures — missing package/version (`E404`, `ETARGET`), refused auth (`E401`/`403`), git refusing outright (bad credentials, dubious ownership) — skip the remaining attempts and fail fast. Stalled `git pull`s abort themselves (`http.lowSpeedLimit`/`http.lowSpeedTime`) instead of hanging until the hard timeout. Merge conflicts or failed restores are never auto-resolved — the result reports `attempts`, a `stash` summary, and the last output. Child, parent, and bundle actions preserve the package row's explicit eligible profiles; global Update all remains separate and never updates every same-named dependency blindly.

A `link:` checkout can also be **switched to a remote source**: the copilot replaces the dependency spec with the newest published npm version (npm registry first), or with `github:owner/repo#<origin HEAD>` when the package has no npm release. The local link breaks and future updates follow the normal npm/github channel. Switching is destructive, so it always requires explicit confirmation and is never part of the default pull path.

## When DSH will not start

If a third-party plugin `import { aRemovedName } from '@deepseek-ai/…'`, the loader fails the whole plugin tree and the copilot UI never mounts. From any Node shell:

```sh
node ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/dsh-update-copilot/lib/cli.js
# linked install:
node /path/to/dsh-update-copilot/lib/cli.js
```

It checks the **on-disk DSH** only (no npm, no target-version preview), so it still runs when DSH will not boot. Exit 1 when the current host is already incompatible (prints disable / uninstall commands).

## Security

- The only mutating route is `POST /dsh-update-copilot/update`: same-origin and same-transport-scheme checks are enforced, with `confirm: true` required; forwarded scheme headers are not trusted. TLS-terminating proxies may set `DSH_UPDATE_COPILOT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` to their public HTTP(S) origin; requests must match it exactly, and an invalid value fails closed.
- Official `@deepseek-ai/*` packages and the dsh core are never auto-updated; the core's upgrade command is displayed, not run.
- All upstream queries are read-only (`registry.npmjs.org`, `api.github.com`, `git ls-remote`) with hard timeouts; a failed check degrades that one item instead of failing the scan.

## Limitations

- Plugin hot reload is phase-1 scoped: it covers updates whose running profile entry still exists and whose new version keeps the same `dsh.bundle.patch` and `dsh.client` declaration (this includes `link:` checkouts — node_modules points at the checkout through a symlink, so the pull takes effect on the same files the reloader reads). Bundle-patch changes, non-current profiles, and copilot self-update still ask for a `dsh` restart.
- `link:` updates require the checkout to have an upstream branch configured; uncommitted changes are auto-stashed and restored after the pull, and a failed restore (stash pop conflict) needs manual `git stash list` / `git stash pop`.
- Switching a `link:` to a remote source breaks the local link and there is no automatic switch back (the spec must be edited by hand). The npm-first strategy installs the registry version, which may differ from your local development checkout.
- Unauthenticated GitHub API is rate-limited (60 req/h) — briefs degrade gracefully to version lists.
- Raw `git+https://` specs are reported as-is without a comparison channel.
- The host export check is static named imports: dynamic `import()`, APIs only reached at runtime, and `import * as ns` are not flagged. Official `@deepseek-ai/*` packages are skipped. The target pass only packs `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` at the DSH version line; a failed pack or an independently versioned package (`cordis`, `schemastery`) is skipped rather than reported as incompatible.
