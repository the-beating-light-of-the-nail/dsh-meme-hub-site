[中文说明](README.zh.md)

Message-anchored project-file recovery for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness), with an option to restart from the restored request.

**Turn Rewind** is the user-facing feature, repository, and Profile Bundle name. **Change Ledger** is the durable restore engine underneath it: the `ctx.changeLedger` service, on-disk format, and storage path keep that name because they describe the reusable snapshot and recovery layer rather than the Web action alone.

Change Ledger gives a DSH session an explicit safety boundary around workspace mutations:

```text
create restore point
        ↓
agent / user / external tools modify the worktree
        ↓
preview exact path-level drift
        ↓
review a full or selective restore plan
        ↓
press the final restore button in the rewind dialog
        ↓
create rescue point → restore → verify
```

It never commits, stashes, resets, switches branches, edits the Git index, or decides automatically that a change should be reverted.

## Preview

Rewind appears as an icon-only third action under each user message, after its timestamp and native Copy action:

Opening it shows the affected files and offers three choices: restore the files and restart from before that message, restore only the files, or rewind only the messages and leave the files untouched:

## Why it has a Change Ledger engine

A diff button can show current changes, but it does not own a durable restore lifecycle. Change Ledger owns:

- content-addressed restore-point manifests;
- Git worktree, HEAD, branch, and in-progress-operation fences;
- stale-plan detection between review and mutation;
- exact two-step confirmation plus DSH human approval;
- automatic pre-restore rescue points;
- post-restore hash verification;
- rollback after a failed restore;
- startup reconciliation of interrupted restore journals;
- a public `ctx.changeLedger` service that other plugins can consume.

The durable format is documented in [docs/FORMAT.md](docs/FORMAT.md). The security and failure model is documented in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Safety contract

- **Explicit only:** nothing is restored automatically — every restore starts from the user pressing the final button in the Web dialog, or from an explicit call through the service API.
- **Read before write:** the dialog preview generates an expiring, session-bound plan from the current tree and changes no files.
- **Human gate:** the dialog's reviewed impact plus the final restore button is the human decision; direct mutation requests without a live session-bound plan pair fail closed.
- **Rescue before mutation:** every restore captures the current eligible tree as a durable rescue point before changing a path.
- **No silent omission:** unsupported submodules, sparse checkouts, oversized files, aggregate limits, and unsupported file types fail point creation.
- **No path escape:** every durable path is canonical and workspace-relative; restore refuses symlink parents and non-empty directory replacement.
- **No stale overwrite:** selected paths and the reviewed HEAD/branch/operation fence are checked again at apply time. Any relevant post-review change invalidates the plan.
- **No Git control-plane mutation:** the index, branch, HEAD, stash, and commits remain untouched.

## Scope

Version `0.1` intentionally supports normal Git worktrees only:

- tracked files, including currently missing tracked paths;
- untracked files not excluded by `.gitignore` or other standard Git excludes;
- regular files, binary or text;
- symbolic links;
- executable and other portable permission bits.

The following are rejected or deliberately outside the snapshot:

- sparse checkouts;
- submodule gitlinks (create a restore point inside each submodule instead);
- ignored files;
- special files, sockets, devices, and named pipes;
- extended attributes, ACLs, ownership, timestamps, and hard-link topology;
- the Git index and repository metadata;
- non-Git directories.

If an ignored or otherwise unmanaged file occupies a path that restoration would replace, the restore fails rather than deleting it.

## Install

Build the checked-out plugin, then add it to each DSH profile that should expose the service:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run check

dsh plugin --profile web add @anionex/dsh-turn-rewind
dsh plugin --profile headless add @anionex/dsh-turn-rewind

dsh --profile web --dump-config | grep turn-rewind
```

Restart a running profile after changing its bundle list.

The package is a DSH Profile Bundle. `package.json` declares `dsh.bundle.patch`, and `cordis.patch.yml` mounts `@anionex/dsh-turn-rewind` without a DSH core patch.

When the profile also provides the DSH Agent service, the plugin captures a hidden checkpoint in the first `agent/pre-step` waterfall before the Agent processes the opening user message. Capture failures are reported but do not reject the user's turn; the corresponding message simply has no usable rewind point. In Web profiles, the same-origin `/turn-rewind` endpoint resolves the selected `user/message` sequence, exposes a paged file preview, mints a short-lived session-bound restore plan, and delegates child creation to DSH's official Host create/fork lifecycle. It never restores files automatically.

## User flow

In the Web profile, each direct user message gains a compact, icon-only **Rewind** action after its timestamp and native Copy control. The tooltip reads “Return to before sending this message.” Opening Rewind checks the saved file state, shows a concise preview with a “view all files” action, and offers three modes:

| Mode | Code | Conversation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Restore files and restart** (default when files changed) | Restores the project files after automatically backing up their current state. | Creates and opens a Session ending before the selected message, then puts that message's text back in the composer. |
| **Restore files only** | Restores the project files after automatically backing up their current state. | Leaves the current Session open and unchanged. |
| **Rewind messages only** (default when no checkpoint or no file changes) | Leaves the project files exactly as they are. | Creates and opens a Session ending before the selected message, then puts that message's text back in the composer. |

The dialog itself is the confirmation: there is no duplicate checkbox. It describes each file as restoring an earlier version, finding a deleted file, removing a later-added file, or restoring permissions/type. **Rewind messages only** is always available — including when the checkpoint for that message is missing, was skipped (for example after disabling automatic checkpoints), or the project files already match the saved state — because it never touches the worktree. It is not blocked by other running Agents in the same worktree.

Before mutation, Turn Rewind rechecks the selected files and repository state, then creates an automatic backup. Changes made after preview invalidate the operation. Any running Agent using the same worktree, including the source Session, blocks restoration; idle Sessions do not block. A reviewed HEAD or branch difference does not block restoration: commits, refs, branch, and index remain unchanged, so restored content may appear as ordinary uncommitted changes against the current HEAD. An in-progress Git operation still blocks. If child creation fails after “restore and restart,” Change Ledger automatically restores the pre-operation files from the backup.

DSH Session logs are append-only, so “restart” creates a new Session instead of truncating the original. For the first message, the Host creates a blank Session in the same working directory; for later messages, it forks at the previous completed `turn/end`. A child may reuse an ancestor's prompt checkpoint only while both the selected `user/message` and its exact `turn/start` remain inside every durable `seedLength` fence. Direct child checkpoints take priority and sibling checkpoints never mix. **Turn Rewind** always treats the two dimensions independently: the two restore modes change project files (optionally followed by a new conversation), while **Rewind messages only** reuses the same fork lifecycle without touching files. The original Session is always retained.

## Configuration

Runtime-tunable options are editable in the DSH web settings page under **Plugins → Turn Rewind** (`turn-rewind` settings namespace). Changes apply live to the next capture, restore, or deletion; they persist in the host's `settings.yaml` and override the profile patch values below. `storageDir` is deliberately not editable there: the storage root must not move while the engine holds locks and journals, so it stays a patch-layer field.

Override the composition base (and `storageDir`) in the profile patch layer:

```yaml
- id: turn-rewind
  config:
    storageDir: ~/.dsh/change-ledger/v1
    maxRestorePoints: 50
    maxTurnCheckpointsPerSession: 30
    maxFiles: 20000
    maxFileBytes: 16777216
    maxSnapshotBytes: 536870912
    planTtlMs: 900000
    staleLockMs: 30000
    turnCheckpointMode: legacy   # off | git-native | legacy; "off" stops creating file checkpoints
    turnCheckpointTimeoutMs: 5000
    turnCheckpointMaxNewBytes: 33554432
    turnCheckpointTrust: fast    # fast | strict
```

Setting `turnCheckpointMode: off` (in the patch or in the settings card) stops automatic file checkpoints; every turn records a durable skip instead, and the rewind dialog still offers **Rewind messages only** for those messages.

All size and user-point retention limits fail loudly. Automatic turn checkpoints have a separate per-session retention window and prune only their own oldest checkpoints; user and rescue restore points are never silently pruned. When omitted, `storageDir` resolves to `$DSH_HOME/change-ledger/v1` and falls back to `~/.dsh/change-ledger/v1`; it must not overlap the managed worktree.

## Checkpoint management

The same settings card includes a storage manager backed by the same-origin `/turn-rewind/manage` endpoint. It lists every workspace this storage root has ever tracked — including projects whose directory no longer exists — grouped with checkpoint counts, approximate sizes, and pending-recovery badges. Per checkpoint, per workspace, or globally (**Clear all**), it deletes unprotected restore points and garbage-collects unreferenced blobs. Restore points still referenced by an incomplete recovery journal, a running restore, or an unfinished Git-native publish are retained and reported. Git-native (v2) checkpoints live in the repository's Git object database, so their disk space is reclaimed by normal Git garbage collection; the displayed sizes are logical values.

## Recovery

Before writing any path, a restore creates a rescue point and a durable operation journal. If DSH stops with a non-terminal journal, the next plugin startup marks it `interrupted` unless another live DSH process still owns that workspace lock.

Recovery uses the public `ctx.changeLedger` service API: `listRecovery` finds the operation's `rescuePointId`, `inspect` reviews that rescue point, then `planRestore`/`applyRestore` handle the affected paths. Rescue points remain ordinary, inspectable restore points until explicitly deleted.

## Public service

Other Cordis plugins can inject `changeLedger` and call the same lifecycle through the structured service API:

```ts
export const inject = ['changeLedger']

export async function apply(ctx: Context) {
  const point = await ctx.changeLedger.create({
    cwd: '/absolute/git/worktree',
    sessionId: 'session-id',
    label: 'before refactor',
  })
  // point.id is a durable restore-point id.
}
```

The complete exported types are available from `@anionex/dsh-turn-rewind/format`; the engine is available from `@anionex/dsh-turn-rewind/core` for non-Cordis tests and trusted integrations.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run check
```

The test suite creates real temporary Git repositories and covers full/selective restore, stale plans, ignored-path collision refusal, HEAD drift, rescue rollback, crash reconciliation, active-lock preservation, durable-state integrity, symlinks, size limits, sparse checkouts, submodules, deletion, and blob garbage collection.
