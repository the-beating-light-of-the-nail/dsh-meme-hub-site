`dsh-requirements-alignment` is a lightweight runtime drift guard for **DeepSeek Harness (DSH)**. It turns the user's intent into a durable requirement baseline, stays out of the way while the agent works, and only interrupts when the next step would materially change the direction.

**You decide the direction. The agent decides the engineering.**

Current package: **v0.4.2**, targeting DeepSeek Harness **0.1.1-rc.2**. Requires Node.js **>=22.18.0**.

## The problem

Long-running coding agents are good at keeping momentum. That is also how they can drift.

A task may start as:

```text
Fix the result-page filter.
Do not refactor backend logic.
```

Later the agent discovers that a cleaner solution would require backend changes. Without an explicit guardrail, it may simply expand the scope and continue.

Requirements Alignment changes that behavior:

```text
User intent
   ↓
Durable requirement baseline
   ↓
Agent works normally
   ↓
Direction-changing step detected?
   ├─ No  → keep working silently
   └─ Yes → ask once → record decision → continue
```

## What counts as drift

The plugin is interested in **direction-level changes**, not implementation trivia.

Typical drift candidates include:

- expanding or shrinking the approved scope;
- violating an explicit constraint;
- changing user-visible behavior;
- switching architecture or product form;
- invalidating a settled assumption;
- changing a previously approved user decision;
- taking a destructive path that changes the intended outcome.

It should **not** stop the agent to ask about variable names, helper placement, ordinary refactors inside the approved scope, or other routine engineering choices.

## Requirements Alignment vs Plan Mode

```text
Plan Mode asks:
"Is this the right implementation plan?"

Requirements Alignment asks:
"Are we still solving the right problem?"
```

Plan Mode helps before implementation starts. Requirements Alignment protects intent **during execution**.

They are complementary:

```text
Plan → approve → execute → detect direction drift → re-align only when needed
```

## Quick start

Install into your DSH Web profile:

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-requirements-alignment
```

Then use DSH normally.

**Auto mode is the recommended default.** Clear tasks continue with zero interruption. When a real direction change appears, the plugin surfaces one decision and records the result.

Use `/align` any time you want an explicit status check.

## Three modes

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| **Auto** | Watches for direction-level drift and asks only when necessary |
| **Manual** | No automatic drift policy; use `/align` when you want a check |
| **Off** | Alignment capabilities are disabled for that session; `/align-mode` remains available so you can switch back |

Common commands:

```text
/align
/align-mode
/align-mode auto
/align-mode manual
/align-mode off
/align-mode reset
```

Per-session control:

```text
/align-mode session
/align-mode session auto
/align-mode session manual
/align-mode session off
/align-mode session reset
```

A session override changes only that session. Shared runtime settings remain separate.

## Example

### Stay inside the original scope

```text
User:
Improve the result-page filter. Do not refactor backend logic.

Agent:
[works normally]

Agent discovers:
A complete fix would require backend changes.

Requirements Alignment:
[reports a drift candidate and asks]

User:
Stay within the current scope.

Agent:
[keeps the backend untouched and continues within the approved direction]
```

### Approve a real direction change

```text
User:
The app is single-user and local-only.

Later:
Make it work across devices.

Requirements Alignment:
[detects that accounts/cloud sync may change the architecture]

User:
Approve the direction change: multi-user with accounts and cloud sync.

Agent:
[records the new baseline revision and continues]
```

## How it works

The plugin provides a small set of alignment primitives:

- `establish_baseline` records the current goal, explicit constraints, must-preserve behavior, allowed scope and settled user decisions;
- `report_drift` surfaces a material direction change, asks through DSH's native user-question path and records the exact decision;
- `/align` reports current alignment status and requests a fresh inspection;
- `/align-mode` changes Auto / Manual / Off behavior without requiring you to uninstall the plugin.

Canonical alignment state is kept in durable sidecar storage instead of being mixed into normal DSH session events. That keeps resume/fork/compaction behavior stable and avoids turning the session log into a plugin-specific state database.

## Runtime mode model

Effective mode follows this order:

```text
valid session override
        ↓
valid persisted runtime override
        ↓
valid profile default
        ↓
auto
```

This means two live sessions can use different alignment modes without leaking state into each other.

Switching modes changes which alignment capabilities are active. It does **not** delete the requirement baseline or drift history.

## Web UI

In supported DSH Web builds, the plugin includes a small floating alignment control that exposes the current session mode and shared mode without requiring manual profile edits.

The UI and `/align-mode` operate on the same underlying state, so they are intended to stay consistent.

## Long-running tasks can wait and continue

When the agent genuinely needs your decision, the expected behavior is to wait instead of guessing.

The same design principle applies to requirement drift: pause for the high-impact choice, record it, then continue from the new baseline.

## What this plugin does not do

- It does **not** replace DSH Plan Mode.
- It does **not** turn every engineering choice into a user question.
- It does **not** require a full PRD or spec before work can start.
- It does **not** rewrite DSH core packages.
- It does **not** continuously interrupt clear tasks.
- It does **not** delete alignment state when modes change.

## Uninstall

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web rm dsh-requirements-alignment
```

`Off` is not the same as uninstalling: Off keeps the plugin installed so the session can switch back to Auto or Manual at runtime.

## Design goal

The project deliberately avoids becoming a full requirements-management system.

Its job is narrower:

> **Protect the few human decisions that define what is being built, then let the agent work.**

## Development focus

The implementation is designed around:

- durable baseline and drift state;
- session-scoped mode isolation;
- resume / fork / compaction continuity;
- hot mode switching without duplicate registrations or listener leaks;
- compatibility with normal DSH session semantics;
- minimal interruption when the requested direction is already clear.
