**The best [DeepSeek Harness plugin](https://www.deepseek.com/harness/) for Agent's context insights and management.**

`dsh-context` provides full context lifecycle management features.
- **Context tab** — an UI context dashboard for DeepSeek Harness’s context stats, composition, history, events, and messages.
- **`/context` command** — the slash command shows the context model for current context composition and recent context evolution.

## Install / Update

To Install from any DeepSeek Harness installation:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-context
```

Or to update the `dsh-context` plugin:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-context@latest
```

Then start the web UI with `dsh web`. No build step, no restart.

## Use it

### Context tab

Open any session and click the **Context / 上下文** tab:

![Context panel overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenliang123/dsh-context/78bbb0fbdf8791af76b198626842e44616d5dab3/docs/context-overview.png)

### ⌨️ `/context` command — In-session Context Insight modal

Type `/context` (or pick it from the `/` menu) and press Enter: a centered dialog shows the **Current Composition** card and the **Context browser** — the same composition bar, legend, and per-step browsing as the tab, so you can inspect what any request was assembled from without leaving the chat.

### ⚙️ Settings — per-user preferences

In **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration**, the **Context / 上下文** card holds this plugin's per-user preferences — currently the **default trend granularity** (Step/Turn) the Context tab opens with. In-chart toggling stays per-view and never overwrites the stored preference. The card appears only when the Host half is installed and the settings document is writable (a remote browser keeps settings process-local and shows no card).

## What you'll see

### 📊 Context stats — the session at a glance

Turns, steps, how many injections, compactions, and prunes have happened.

### 🧱 Current composition — what's in the window right now

A six-color stacked bar scaled against the model's full context window (the gray track is your remaining headroom): system prompt, tool schemas, your messages, injected context, assistant replies, and tool results — plus the top-5 most expensive tool schemas. When a conversation starts degrading, this is where you find out *which part ate the budget*.

The headline occupancy and the composition counts read the **same official token-meter projections the chat composer's context ring reads** (`contextPressure` / `contextBreakdown`), so the legend's `≈` figures and proportions match the ring's click-open panel exactly; the message bucket is subdivided into the four surface categories by the fold's per-category ratios.

### 📈 History — watch the window grow (and get compacted)

One stacked bar per model request, finer than per-message. Toggle between **Turn** and **Step** granularity, scroll sideways through the session, hover any bar for a quick tooltip, and click to pin the full breakdown — including provider-reported actual prompt/output tokens next to the estimate. **Hovering a bar also drives the Context browser beside it** — the browser previews that step's assembled context in real time as you scrub across the history. **✂ marks where compaction or pruning happened** — watch the bars drop:

Above: a real session that grew to ~563k tokens across 48 turns, then compaction (✂) recycled −535.5k in one step, and the conversation continued from a fresh, small window.

In **Step** granularity, hovering any bar shows that single step's context info instantly — its turn/step, timestamp, and estimated vs. provider-reported token counts:

### ⚡ Context events — when and why the window changed

Every compaction, tool-output prune, skill or plugin context injection, model switch, and plan-mode toggle — each labeled with its producer source (instruction file paths, plugin id, skill name), its token delta (compactions/prunes show the **net** reclaimed amount, matching the chart's drop), turn/step attribution, and timestamp. Filter by category (**Inject / Compact / Prune / Switch / Mode**) to see exactly when each kind of event happened and its impact — e.g. when a skill was injected, when instructions were added, or how much a compaction reclaimed:

### 💬 Messages — the currently model-visible surface

The exact message list the model sees right now, newest first, with a per-message token cost.

### 🧭 Context browser — open the box of any request

Pick **Live (next request)** or any retained step from the picker, and browse what that request was actually assembled from:

![Context browser](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenliang123/dsh-context/78bbb0fbdf8791af76b198626842e44616d5dab3/docs/context-browser.png)

Six collapsible category sections (system prompt, tool schemas, user messages, injected context, assistant replies, tool results) expand into one row per element — each with its token price — and every element expands again into its **actual content**: the full system prompt, each tool's description and JSON schema, message text, reasoning, tool-call arguments, and tool outputs.

- **Linked with the history chart** — hover any bar in the History card and the browser previews that step instantly; leave the chart and it returns to your own pick. Keep a category open while scrubbing to compare one category across steps.
- **Honest about coverage** — steps before a compaction are reconstructed from the removed-message archive, and the card says so when a step's makeup is only approximate. Elements older than the loaded chat window page older history in automatically when you expand them, and live injections (AGENTS.md, session-start context, …) are always listed — never a token sum without its items.

### 🖼 Multimodal — image attachments in full view (DeepSeek Harness 0.1.1+)

Fully adapted to DeepSeek Harness 0.1.1's multimodal pipeline and the vision capability of **DeepSeek-V4-Flash-Vision-Exp**. A user message carrying images expands into a card layout — prose in the text card (with the usual raw/Markdown toggle), each image attachment as a thumbnail card in an equal-width two-column grid with its name, normalized dimensions (plus the pre-normalization size when 0.1.1's image pipeline downscaled it), stored size, and **estimated token cost** — priced by DeepSeek's official image-size→token conversion (the docs' image token calculator; 117–384 tokens per image under the provider's per-image cap), the same estimate the message/token breakdowns carry — and anything unrecognized as raw content:

![Context browser rendering image attachments](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bowenliang123/dsh-context/78bbb0fbdf8791af76b198626842e44616d5dab3/docs/context-browser-images.png)

Images load through the harness's own session-authorized loader — the same one the chat history uses — and degrade to metadata-only cards when it is unavailable. Image blocks in assistant messages and tool results (e.g. `read_image` output) now render too, instead of being silently dropped.
