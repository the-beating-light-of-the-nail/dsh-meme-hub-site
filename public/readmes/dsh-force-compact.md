# dsh-force-compact

**Aggressive, local-first context compaction for DeepSeek Harness agents.**

A DSH **Cordis function plugin** that keeps the agent's working context lean by design: serve
`Qwen3.8‑27B` on a self-hosted llama.cpp with a modest context, and the plugin shrinks the
conversation itself — a large-window feel with no API cost and no data egress.

[中文](README.cn.md)

---

## Why

- **Self-hosted inference** — the agent talks to a local OpenAI-compatible llama.cpp server
  through the standard DeepSeek adapter; no separate adapter needed.
- **Low context, high signal** — instead of fighting a small cap, the plugin shrinks the
  conversation, so the agent reasons over a tight prompt while keeping deep memory in the
  compressed head.
- **Think off for compactions, passthrough everywhere else** — `disableThinking: true`
  (default) turns thinking off on *this plugin's own compaction summarization call only*;
  every other model request rides the machine's configuration unchanged.
- **Private & free** — no per-token billing, no egress.

---

## What it does

Two compaction engines coexist behind one facade (`resolveCompaction`), transparent to callers:

| Engine | Used when | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Official** | the `compaction` service resolves in the agent realm | Preferred; delegates to `compaction/basic`. |
| **Builtin** | automatic fallback (typical standard preset isolates the service) | Self-contained persistent transaction on `ctx.sessions` / `ctx.llm.stream` / `ctx.tokenMeter`; reuses the official `compaction/*` event vocabulary, so it replays safely across builds. |

No toggling — official wins when reachable, builtin takes over otherwise.

### Trigger points

- **Per-request guard (`agent/pre-step`)** — reads the session's *projected* context tokens
  (the exact number the harness renders bottom-right). At `autoThresholdTokens` it rejects the
  outgoing request and compacts the head instead, retaining the latest `retainLatestTokens`
  verbatim. Below the threshold the request proceeds.
- **Turn end / idle (`agent/status` → `idle`)** — when the agent quiesces, optionally
  compacts via `compactNow` (gate: `turnEndForceCompactionEnabled`).
- **Manual `/force-compact`** — immediate `compactNow` when idle; when busy it queues a
  process-local flag consumed at the next model step. **Loaded lazily** — see "Command
  availability" under Install.
- **`session/flush`** — the awaited durability checkpoint.

Every path funnels into the single *"compaction result landed in the session"* boundary — the
same point where the LiveUI signal fires.

Decision key is `projectedTokens` (provider-anchored, same figure as the UI corner), so the
plugin never drifts from what you see; the threshold-aware shrink gate skips summarizer calls
that provably cannot pull the session below the threshold (kills the low-threshold dead loop).

The builtin transaction bills `shadowedTokenCount` from the **same** `tokenMeter.measure`
per-node prices the official engine uses, so the meter's collapse protocol settles the drop
correctly — the bottom-right counter goes *down* after compaction.

### Thinking control: scoped to compactions

Since the 2026-08 semantics revision, `disableThinking` controls **one thing**: whether this
plugin's own summarization call (`engine/builtin.js` → `engine/summarizer.js` →
`ctx.llm.stream`) carries `reasoningEffort:'off'`. Everything else is untouched:

| Call site | With `disableThinking: true` |
|---|---|
| Builtin-engine summarization call | Carries `reasoningEffort:'off'` |
| Every other model request (business, sub-agents, tools, other plugins) | Machine's `LlmCallConfig` unchanged |
| Official `compaction` service calls | Not routed through any plugin seam — unaffected |

When the target is a **llama.cpp / OpenAI-compatible endpoint**, the
`thinking: { type: 'disabled' }` field the adapter emits is silently ignored there — so the
summarizer ALSO stamps the llama.cpp-native top-level `reasoning_effort: "none"`, gated on
the exact same condition. One options object carries BOTH fields:

| Endpoint family | Reads | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Real DeepSeek API | `reasoningEffort:'off'` → `thinking:{type:'disabled'}` | Thinking off ✅ |
| llama.cpp / OAI-compatible | `reasoning_effort:"none"` (top-level) | `enable_thinking=false` ✅ |

Each family tolerates-and-ignores the foreign key, so emitting both is harmless. The field is
stamped in `src/engine/summarizer.js` (immediately before `llm.stream(options)`), NOT in the
`llm/stream` waterfall — a prior draft injected there but proved ineffective structurally
(middle-layer returns are discarded; in-place seed mutation crashes the host); see the
`src/hooks/wire-rewrite.js` module header for the write-up. That hook now serves only the
LiveUI watermark role.

Need thinking off on **business calls** too? Set your provider's `reasoningEffort` at the
request-header level — the plugin deliberately stays out of that decision.

#### Observability: per-attempt audit lines

Every summarization attempt logs two lines (visible at the default `debug: true`) — the
durable proof of the scoping decision and its wire fields, without capturing traffic:

```
[force-compact] <sessionId>: compaction thinking-policy — settings.disableThinking=true → extra.reasoningEffort='off' (this summarization call carries thinking-OFF)
[force-compact] <sessionId>: summarization wire-fields → <provider>/<model>: reasoningEffort='off' + reasoning_effort="none" (llama.cpp-native wire field)
```

- **Line 1** (`engine/builtin.js`) records where `disableThinking` is read and routed into
  the call options; with the setting off it records *machine default*.
- **Line 2** (`engine/summarizer.js`) records both wire fields exactly as they leave the
  options object, plus resolved provider/model; unstamped fields are labeled `(absent…)`.

Empirically grounded: probed against a local llama.cpp endpoint, a baseline request returned
populated `reasoning_content` (the model thinks by default), while the same request with
top-level `reasoning_effort:"none"` returned none at all — the field genuinely disables
thinking there, and business calls (which omit it) keep thinking.

### LiveUI status

A tiny host→client messenger (the `liveUi` settings field mirrored live to the browser) pins a
badge beside the turn:

- **Red "compressing"** — just before a compaction commits (screen text is Chinese);
- **Green "done"** — the instant a compaction lands; 3 s later a fresh random working line
  takes over;
- **Blue "working"** — otherwise a rotating playful one-liner.

Publishers are fail-safe: a messenger glitch can never disturb the actual compaction.

## How it works

```
agent/request(payload, next)              # every model request
    return await next()                  # pure pass-through (thinking-off scopes
                                          # ONLY to the plugin's own summarizer)

agent/pre-step(payload, next)             # before each model step
    projectedTokens >= autoThresholdTokens?
        no  -> next()                     # let the request proceed
        yes -> compactRegion(head-before-retainLatestTokens, signal)
               return { kind: "reject" }  # no model request this step

agent/status({ agent, status })          # lifecycle transition
    status === "idle" && turnEndForceCompactionEnabled?
        -> compactNow(agent, freshSignal) # turn-end compaction

session/flush(session)                   # durability checkpoint
    select region -> project messages -> preview + shrink gate
    -> compaction.compactRegion(start, end, agent, signal)
```

Supporting modules:

- `src/hooks/guard.js` — `agent/request` pure pass-through + `pre-step` threshold gate +
  process-local force flag (`thinkingDisabled` survives only as a legacy predicate).
- `src/hooks/command.js` — the `/force-compact` command (lazily registered).
- `src/hooks/idle.js` — turn-end forced compaction.
- `src/hooks/wire-rewrite.js` — the `llm/stream` LiveUI watermark hook (no wire manipulation;
  historical note in the module header).
- `src/engine/region.js` — head/tail-anchored region selection (with the official pairing ledger).
- `src/engine/summarizer.js` — the one-shot LLM summarizer, fully aligned with official
  `compaction-basic` (target resolution, prefix-cache alignment, `purpose:'compaction'` tag,
  fail-closed finish classification, usage capture).
- `src/engine/builtin.js` — the builtin persistent transaction (official `compaction/*` vocab).
- `src/engine/checkpoint.js` — preview + shrink gate + delegation to the compaction service.
- `src/core/projected.js` — provider-anchored `projectedTokens`.
- `src/core/ui-signal.js` — the LiveUI messenger.

## Install

As an installable package (recommended):

```sh
# from npm (published):
npm install @falling-ts/dsh-force-compact
# from git:
dsh plugin --profile web add github:falling-ts/dsh-force-compact
# from a local checkout:
dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-force-compact
```

Or, from a local checkout, as a `--patch` overlay without installing:

```sh
dsh web --patch dsh-force-compact/cordis.patch.yml
```

The plugin is loaded iff `~/.dsh/logs/dsh-force-compact.log` gains:

```
[force-compact] debug logging enabled — writing [force-compact] lines to <absolute path>
```

### Command availability — `/force-compact` loads lazily

The `commands` service arrives with the agent-presets plane, **after** the plugin's boot-time
`apply`, so registration happens at the first guarded-listener activation
(`agent/request` / `agent/pre-step` / `agent/status` / `session/flush`), settling
permanently on the first success. Practical effect: **after (re)starting the instance, a
fresh session's `/` picker does NOT show `/force-compact` until that session makes its first
model request** — send any one message, then the command is registered process-wide.

- Success: `[force-compact] /force-compact command registered (deferred)`
- `commands` permanently absent: one `… still UNREGISTERED 10 min …` warn explains the
  empty picker. Until registered, the rest of the plugin works — degradation, not an
  install failure.

Verify a compaction happened:

```
idle compaction (builtin) shadowed N nodes (~M tokens)
builtin compaction OK — replaced span seq[A..B] (N nodes, ~K tokens) with a P-char checkpoint
compaction thinking-policy — settings.disableThinking=true → extra.reasoningEffort='off' (…)
summarization wire-fields → <provider>/<model>: reasoningEffort='off' + reasoning_effort="none" (…)
```

(The last two lines are the per-attempt audit pair described under "Observability".)

## Settings

`$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml`, namespace `falling-ts-force-compact`:

| key | type | default | meaning |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `disableThinking` | boolean | `true` | Only the plugin's own summarization call carries `reasoningEffort:'off'`; everything else unchanged. |
| `autoThresholdTokens` | number ≥ 32000 | `32000` | Projected-token trigger for the gate. **Floor 32000** (clamps back up at read time). |
| `retainLatestTokens` | positive int ≥ 8000 | `8000` | Retain the latest N tokens verbatim; older history is summarized in one batch. **Floor 8000.** Drives both the auto gate and `/force-compact`. |
| `turnEndForceCompactionEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Compact on the agent's `idle` transition. |
| `debug` | boolean | `true` | Emit `[force-compact]` diagnostics to the plugin log. |
| `logFile` | string | `~/.dsh/logs/dsh-force-compact.log` | Diagnostics destination (`~` expands to home dir). |
| `compactionMode` | `'realm' \| 'global'` | `'realm'` | Official-service resolution strategy (priority-1 path). |
| `builtinEnabled` | boolean | `true` | Gate for the builtin engine fallback. |
| `maxSummaryTokens` | integer (1024–200000) | `1024` | Cap on the summarizer LLM `maxTokens`. |

Example — an aggressive **local** profile:

```yaml
falling-ts-force-compact:
  disableThinking: true
  autoThresholdTokens: 40000   # compact sooner ⇒ keep the live prompt small
  retainLatestTokens: 8000
  turnEndForceCompactionEnabled: true
```

Without the `settings` service the plugin falls back to the same defaults and still compacts —
the namespace is optional, never a hard dependency.

### Tuning for low-context llama.cpp

Keep `autoThresholdTokens` comfortably **below** the served context: the live prompt stays
small and latency flat, while the agent keeps deep memory through the compressed head.
Pressure is measured in *projected* tokens (provider-anchored), so the threshold maps
predictably onto the UI figure.

## Behavior notes

- **Runtime dependency:** the `compaction` service (preset plane
  `agent-presets:compaction-basic`), read live via `ctx.get('compaction')`; unreachable →
  the builtin engine takes over (or the request proceeds).
- **Optional dependencies:** `settings` / `tokenMeter` / `commands` / `llm` / `agents` are
  read via `ctx.get(...)` with guards — a missing one degrades gracefully.
- **Per-request settings read:** parameters are read every model request, so edits take
  effect on the next request without a restart.
- **Signals:** `agent/*` Waterfalls forward the current turn's signal; the `session/flush`
  checkpoint and the `agent/status` idle listener each mint a fresh `AbortController`.
- **Persistence:** durable output is the `compaction/*` bracket events + a
  `surfaceOp:replace` `user/message` checkpoint, replay-safe across builds.
- **Client half:** `web/client.js` adds the settings section "Force Compact" (localized
  labels), live-editable without restart (uSES-safe mirror).
- **One intentional timer:** the 3 s `publishDone` fallback (presentation-only, documented
  deviation). Otherwise the plugin is pure listeners + a process-local `Map` force flag.
