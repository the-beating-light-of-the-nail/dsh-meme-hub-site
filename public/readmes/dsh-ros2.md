**dsh-ros2** gives a DSH agent full robot development / debugging capabilities on any host with ROS2, organized in four capability tiers:

| Tier | Capability | Safety boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | Read-only diagnostics: package/workspace/dependency checks, node/topic/service/action/param/interface enumeration, one-shot topic sampling, TF tree queries, whole-graph topology JSON, `ros2doctor`, bag summaries, MoveIt discovery, robot-profile load, safety-state read & VLM semantic arbitration | Pure read-only, no approval |
| **L2** | Approval-gated management: `colcon build` (background job), `rosdep install`, message skeleton generation, `param set`, bounded `bag record`, one-click ROS2 install, launch management, rosbag replay, MoveIt motion, zero-pose calibration, robot registration & topology learning, **safety_monitor start / human-gated lock / unlock** | Writes always ask first (fail-closed) |
| **L3** | Visualization: RViz2 / rqt lifecycle management, screenshots, multimodal vision description, xdotool-level window interaction | Local session operations |
| **L4** | Realtime vision: parallel VLM ROS2 node + image-topic acquisition (headless; `vision_bringup` periodically refreshes per-topic bridges), plus **RViz2 offscreen rendering** (OGRE kernel → `/rviz/scene` topic) | Pure software/GPU rendering, no display needed |

All tools run plain `ros2` / `colcon` / `rosdep` CLI commands on the host; L1 never modifies anything, L2 always asks first.

## Features

- **Zero-intrusion diagnostics**: 51 tools cover most ROS2 debugging scenarios — from "is the package installed?" to "what is on this topic right now?", one command, one answer;
- **Whole-graph topology**: `ros2_graph` folds nodes/publishers/subscribers/services/actions into one JSON — see the system structure in seconds;
- **Approval-gated writes**: builds, dependency installs, message scaffolding etc. go through the DSH approval service; fail-closed, denial = failure;
- **Visualization as a service**: "see" headlessly — screenshots / multimodal description / window interaction are fully local, no remote display;
- **Parallel realtime vision**: the VLM runs in a separate ROS2 process (`vlm_node`, service `/vlm/describe`); images come from topics (`sensor_msgs/Image` / `CompressedImage`); `vision_bringup` auto-creates one bridge per image topic, headless-ready;
- **RViz2 offscreen rendering (motion render ~22 Hz on llvmpipe; 30 Hz full rate with GPU)**: the real rviz render kernel (`rviz_common` + OGRE) renders any `.rviz` scene on a virtual display and publishes it as an image topic — no screenshots, no X11 window-stacking dependency. **Performance optimizations**: open3d low-poly meshes (`scripts/simplify_visual_meshes.py`) + direct OGRE pixel read (no PNG round-trip) + double-render elimination → motion rendering 1.9 → ~22 Hz on llvmpipe (11×), and **30 Hz full rate with NVIDIA GPU passthrough** (v0.9.3), memory −2.5×;
- **Real-time safety framework** (`safety_monitor` node + `robot_safety_*` tools, see [Safety framework](#safety-framework)): layered defense — tool-layer safety gate (pre-execution `/safety/state` check) → reactive monitors (motion tracking/stall with hysteresis, joint-feedback loss, watchdog, optional torque) → event-driven VLM semantic arbitration → human arbitration. Latched `NORMAL`/`LOCKED` state machine (lock persists until a human unlocks; non-fatal events never lock); every threshold/topic/lock-action is registered per robot in the profile `safety` section; the geometric pre-check (joint limits / velocity / FK self-collision) is a reserved layer;
- **Bundled skills (4)**: `ros2-diagnostics` (which tool to use when, narrow-down methodology), `robot-state-vision-analysis` (status → offscreen render → VLM → cross-check), `robot-registration` (first-contact body profile + topology baseline) and `robot-retrieval` (instant profile load and bring-up).

## Quick start

### Requirements

- A host with ROS2 (**Jazzy** verified; Humble should work), `ros2` on `PATH`;
- Node `^22.19 || >=24` (DSH host requirement);
- L4 vision additionally needs Python 3 `rclpy` and an OpenAI-compatible VLM gateway (e.g. Gemini or a self-hosted gateway).

### Install the plugin

```bash
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add dsh-ros2
```

### Minimal configuration

```yaml
# fragment of a DSH profile plugin config
- insert:
    - id: dsh-ros2
      name: dsh-ros2
      config:
        rosSetup: source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash &&   # prepare the ROS2 environment
        workspaceRoot: /home/you/ros2_ws                 # default cwd for colcon/rosdep
        vision:
          provider: gemini                               # mock | gemini | openai
          apiKey: ${GEMINI_API_KEY}                      # inject via env/secret manager, never hard-code
        safetyStrict: warn                               # motion-tool gate when the safety monitor is unreachable: 'warn' (default) | 'reject' (fail-closed); LOCKED always rejects
```

### Three-minute taste

```bash
ros2_graph                          # whole system topology in one shot
ros2_topic_list                     # all topics and types
ros2_topic_echo /joint_states       # sample one frame of joint states
ros2_tf_list                        # TF tree edges
ros2_doctor                         # system health report
```

| `ros2_bag_info` | `ros2 bag info <path>` | Bag summary |
| `moveit_discover` | scans MoveIt packages + parses SRDF + probes move_group | Discover MoveIt2 config packages (any package shipping an SRDF), their planning groups and named poses, and whether `/move_action` / `/execute_trajectory` / `/compute_cartesian_path` are online. Pass `srdf` to parse a specific file directly — generic, not bound to a specific package |
| `robot_safety_state` | `ros2 topic echo /safety/state --once` | Read the latched safety state (NORMAL / LOCKED + severity + trigger cause + detail); reports `monitor_running: false` when the monitor is offline |
| `robot_safety_arbitrate` | `ros2 run dsh_ros2_safety safety_vlm_arbitrate ...` | Event-driven VLM semantic arbitration (plan change / post-anomaly): fixed-format prompt + fresh offscreen frame via `/vlm/describe`; any non-safe verdict flags human arbitration |
| `motion_validate` | `motion_validator.py --trajectory <file> --config <json>` | Deterministic pre-execution validation (read-only): joint limits, NaN/Inf, names & group coverage, timestamps/duration, freshness, optional workspace box, fingerprint + TTL — collision/singularity stay with MoveIt planning |

### L2 management (approval-gated)

Every L2 tool performs a **write operation** and asks the user first via the DSH approval service (fail-closed when unavailable or denied). The read-only helpers `ros2_jobs_list` / `ros2_job_status` need no approval.

| Tool | Command behind it | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ros2_colcon_build` | `colcon build [--packages-select ...] [--symlink-install]` | Runs as a **background job** (`ctx.jobs`); returns `jobId`, track with `ros2_job_status` |
| `ros2_rosdep_install` | `rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -y` | `dryRun` previews with `--simulate` |
| `ros2_interface_create` | writes `<root>/<pkg>/<msg\|srv\|action>/<Name>.*` | Skeleton generator; **never overwrites** existing files |
| `ros2_param_set` | `ros2 param set <node> <param> <value>` | JSON numbers/booleans are typed, other values treated as strings |
| `ros2_bag_record` | `ros2 bag record <topics...> --output <dir>` | Bounded recording: stops automatically after `duration` seconds |
| `ros2_jobs_list` | `ctx.jobs.list` | Background jobs of this agent (read-only) |
| `ros2_job_status` | `ctx.jobs.get` | Status of one job by id (read-only) |
| `ros2_install` | FishROS one-click installer (interactive PTY session) | When ROS2 is missing: `check` probes (installed / installed-not-sourced / absent); `start` (approval) launches the installer; `send` / `status` / `stop` drive and observe the interactive menus |
| `ros2_bag_play` | `ros2 bag play <path> [--topics ...] [--rate X] [--loop] [--start-offset S]` | Replay a rosbag into its topics (approval-gated; publishes to the graph); foreground for `timeoutMs` |
| `ros2_launch` | `ros2 launch <pkg> <launch_file> [args]` | Launch a launch file as a **background job** (approval-gated; returns jobId, stop via DSH job controls) |
| `ros2_zero_pose_semantics` | publish-zero → offscreen render → VLM → confirm | Calibrate zero-pose semantics interactively (generic): `analyze` renders the all-zero pose and asks the VLM its posture across three aspects (arm: lateral_raise/hanging, elbow: forward/upward, palm/camera-mount: up/forward/down); `confirm` records the user-approved combo (or a `customText` free-text description) to `~/.dsh-ros2/zero-pose.yaml` for skills |
| `robot_register` | collects URDF/TF/cameras/MoveIt/zero-pose → writes `~/.dsh-ros2/robots/<name>.yaml` | Register a robot body profile on first contact (approval-gated) for instant later reuse |
| `robot_load` | reads `~/.dsh-ros2/robots/<name>.yaml` | Load a registered robot profile as structured JSON (fast path — no discovery); empty name lists all profiles |
| `robot_topology` | aggregate snapshot + progressive node learning (strict schema) | Robot comms topology trade-off: `snapshot` (approval) records node/topic/service lists (light, not verbose); `learn` (approval) records ONE important node's role/description + pub/sub/srv/act; `show` (read-only) reads them back |
| `moveit_move` | unified: `/move_action` + `/execute_trajectory` | **One tool, five essential modes** (approval-gated): `joint_abs`, `joint_rel`, `pose_abs`, `pose_rel` (frame ee/world), `trajectory`. Generic: standard moveit_msgs + SRDF only. **Single motion path: plan → deterministic validation (motion_validator, `robot` profile for full limits) → human approval (validation summary shown) → execute → verify**. Gates on `/safety/state` (LOCKED always rejected; monitor-down per `safetyStrict`) |
| `robot_safety_start` | `ros2 run dsh_ros2_safety safety_monitor --profile <yaml>` | Start the generic safety monitor as a **background job** (approval-gated); all robot-specific values come from the profile `safety` section |
| `robot_safety_lock` / `robot_safety_unlock` | `ros2 service call /safety/set_lock|unlock ...` | **Human-gated** explicit lock / unlock (L2 approval before the call); lock is latched until a human unlocks (recovery: unlock → re-home → resume) |
| `moveit_status` | probes move_group interfaces + samples `/joint_states` | Runtime status: online probe + current joint state + SRDF planning frame (read-only) |

### L3 visualization

GUI lifecycle + screenshots + multimodal vision ("see first, then move") + xdotool-level interaction ("see and move"). Screenshots use Pillow `ImageGrab` on X11 (no extra CLI install); vision providers are pluggable; interaction requires `xdotool` (`sudo apt install xdotool`).

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ros2_gui_start` | Launch RViz2 (with `-d config`) / rqt_graph / rqt on the host display; sessions are tracked |
| `ros2_gui_list` | Tracked sessions + X11 windows (`wmctrl -lG`) |
| `ros2_gui_close` | Close a session (SIGTERM) |
| `ros2_screenshot` | Capture the screen or one window to a PNG |
| `ros2_vision_describe` | Describe an image with the configured multimodal model (Gemini / OpenAI / mock) |
| `ros2_gui_observe` | Ensure a GUI is running → screenshot → return the multimodal description (the "see it" workflow) |
| `ros2_gui_interact` | unified xdotool interaction: `action=click` (click/scroll, `button` 4/5 = scroll), `action=drag` (press-drag-release: RViz2 orbit/pan/zoom), `action=key` (combos like `ctrl+shift+r` or typed text) |

Interaction recipes (model-facing): orbit the RViz2 view with `ros2_gui_interact {action: "drag", windowTitle: "rviz2", button: 1, toX: <dx>, toY: <dy>}`, zoom with `action: "drag", button: 3`, reload a display config with `ros2_gui_interact {action: "key", keys: "ctrl+shift+r"}`. When `wmctrl` cannot enumerate windows (e.g. no window manager on the display), window-relative interaction reports "window not found" — fall back to absolute screen coordinates. Interaction is local to the host session (no approval, same as other L3 tools).

### L4 realtime vision (parallel VLM over ROS2, headless image topics)

Perception matches the robot-control stack: the VLM runs in a **separate ROS2 process** (`vlm_node`, service `/vlm/describe` + cached topic `/vlm/description`), and images come from **`sensor_msgs/Image` topics, never X11 screenshots** — headless-ready. Requires the `dsh_ros2_vlm` ROS2 package (`vlm/`); build/run see [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) §4.

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ros2_image_snapshot` | Grab the latest frame from an image topic (raw / compressed) and save as JPEG |
| `ros2_vlm_analyze` | Analyze an image file or the bridge's latest frame (`useBridge`) via the parallel VLM |
| `ros2_vision_topics` | List live image topics with their auto bridge service names |
| `ros2_vision_analyze` | Analyze any topic's latest frame via its auto bridge (`ros2_vision_analyze {topic, prompt}`) |

```bash
# build + launch the vision pipeline (auto bridge per image topic)
mkdir -p /tmp/vlm_ws/src && ln -s <repo>/vlm /tmp/vlm_ws/src/dsh_ros2_vlm
cd /tmp/vlm_ws && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
VLM_API_KEY=... ros2 run dsh_ros2_vlm vlm_node &       # parallel VLM process
ros2 run dsh_ros2_vlm vision_bringup &                 # discover topics, one bridge each
```

### RViz2 offscreen rendering (`dsh_ros2_rviz_offscreen`)

The real rviz rendering stack (`rviz_common` + OGRE + `rviz_default_plugins`) loads a `.rviz` scene offscreen under Xvfb and publishes it to the `/rviz/scene` image topic — read from the render kernel, not X screenshots, no window-stacking dependency.

```bash
# build (needs a colcon workspace like vlm_ws)
ln -s <repo>/offscreen /tmp/vlm_ws/src/dsh_ros2_rviz_offscreen
cd /tmp/vlm_ws && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
# run (config_path points at a .rviz scene file)
xvfb-run -a -s "-screen 0 1280x800x24" ros2 run dsh_ros2_rviz_offscreen rviz_offscreen_node \
  --ros-args -p config_path:=/tmp/robot_scene.rviz -p topic:=/rviz/scene \
  -p width:=800 -p height:=600 -p rate:=5.0
```

**Robot body mesh rendering essentials** (pitfalls collected; details in [`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) §4.4):

1. **Jazzy RobotModel properties**: use `Description Source: Topic` + `Description Topic: <topic>` (the legacy `Robot Description:` is ignored → `Links` empty);
2. **mesh paths**: use absolute paths or a `file://` prefix in the URDF (bare paths fail in `resource_retriever`); the description publisher must stay alive (transient-local, late subscribers miss it otherwise);
3. **URDF must bind to TF by name**: URDF link names must exactly match the live TF frame names (publishing the robot's actual `/robot_description` works). **Mismatch → every link transform lookup fails → all meshes pile at the fixed-frame origin**;
4. **View distance**: Orbit `Distance` ≈ 1.5–2.0 m for an RViz-like close full-body view (> 5 m shrinks the robot to a tiny center blob);
5. **Health signal**: ~3 s after startup the node logs `FM: ... frames=N` and `transformHasProblems(...)=0` — meshes correctly bound to TF.

## MoveIt2 motion — five essential modes, one tool

**Design intent.** Robot motion through MoveIt is, at its core, only five
operations: set joints absolutely, nudge joints relatively, place the
end-effector at an absolute pose, move it by a relative delta, or execute a
pre-planned trajectory. Rather than a growing zoo of named tools, dsh-ros2
abstracts them into **one tool `moveit_move` with a `mode` parameter** — so the
interface stays small, predictable and scriptable, and works with *any* MoveIt
package (it reads the SRDF and speaks only standard `moveit_msgs`).

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `moveit_discover` (L1) | Read any MoveIt package's SRDF: planning groups, named poses, chain tip; probe the standard interfaces (`/move_action`, `/execute_trajectory`, ...) online |
| `moveit_status` (L1) | Runtime probe: interfaces online + current `/joint_states` sample + SRDF planning frame |
| `moveit_move` (L2, approval) | **One tool, five modes**: `joint_abs` (joints "j1:=v1 j2:=v2"), `joint_rel` (deltaJoints = current + delta), `pose_abs` (pose "x y z rx ry rz" in the planning frame), `pose_rel` (deltaPose "dx dy dz drx dry drz", frame ee/world), `trajectory` (execute a saved trajectory JSON) |

```json
moveit_move {mode: "joint_abs", group: "right_arm", joints: "right_shoulder_roll:=0.5"}
moveit_move {mode: "joint_rel", group: "right_arm", deltaJoints: "right_elbow_pitch:=-0.2"}
moveit_move {mode: "pose_rel",  group: "right_arm", deltaPose: "0.05 0 0 0 0 0"}
moveit_move {mode: "pose_abs",  group: "right_arm", pose: "0.5 0 0.8 0 0 0"}
moveit_move {mode: "trajectory", group: "right_arm", trajectory: "/tmp/traj.json"}
```

**How it works.** `moveit_discover`/`moveit_status` tell you *what* you can move
(groups, joints, EE link from the SRDF chain tip, online state); `moveit_move`
turns any mode into a standard `MoveGroup` goal (`/move_action`), executes via
`/execute_trajectory`, and — with `planOnly` + `trajectoryOut` — saves the
planned trajectory so `mode: "trajectory"` can run it later (plan/execute
separation). Nothing is bound to a specific MoveIt package; only the SRDF path
matters (auto-resolved by package scan, or explicit `srdf`/`package`).

---

## Safety framework

**Design intent.** A two-tier strategy that keeps real-time and semantic
judgment apart (full contract: `docs/safety-handover.md`, the handover doc for
downstream robot-adaptation agents — generic framework/interfaces belong here,
body-specific data sources/schemes/algorithms belong downstream):

```
tool-layer safety gate (pre-execution: /safety/state LOCKED; monitor-down per safetyStrict)
  → reactive monitors (in-execution: motion tracking/stall + hysteresis,
    joint-feedback loss, watchdog, optional torque; detect at control frequency,
    response budget ≤100 ms)
  → VLM semantic arbitration (post plan-change / anomaly, seconds — pulled up only when needed)
  → human arbitration (non-safe verdicts always escalate; human-gated unlock)
```

- **`safety_monitor` node** (`dsh_ros2_safety` package): subscribes the joint
  feedback (+ optional commanded stream / torque stream), runs the checkers on
  a `control_frequency` timer, and latches **`LOCKED`** on any CRITICAL event —
  the latch persists until a human unlocks (no auto-reset into the same danger).
  Publishes `/safety/state` (transient-local), `/safety/event`,
  `/safety/heartbeat`, `/safety/lock_active`; services `/safety/get_state`,
  `/safety/unlock`, `/safety/set_lock`.
- **Latched lock, non-fatal never locks**: any CRITICAL event latches `LOCKED`
  (the latch persists until a human unlocks — no auto-reset into the same
  danger); watchdog separates `critical` (down → lock) from `observed` (down →
  WARNING only); single-frame noise is filtered by M-of-K hysteresis; a
  `WARNING` never latches. Tool-layer fail-closed on monitor-down is per
  `safetyStrict: 'reject'` (default `'warn'` proceeds with a warning).
- **Per-robot registration**: `robot_register` writes a generic `safety`
  section (URDF-derived velocity/effort limits) and auto-launches the monitor;
  `robot_profile.py safety set <key> <json>` updates any threshold/topic/list
  (schema-validated). Torque checking auto-disables when no effort feedback
  exists. **Reserved layers** (interfaces registered, not implemented): the
  geometric pre-check (joint-limit / velocity / FK self-collision on the command
  path — `motion.max_velocity` / `max_acceleration`), the computed-torque
  feedforward input (`torque.feedforward_topic`), YOLO-style lightweight
  triggers, and the non-ROS estop path (`estop`).
- **Tool-layer gate**: `moveit_move` consults `/safety/state` before executing
  — LOCKED always rejected (`SAFETY_LOCKED`); if the monitor is unreachable,
  `safetyStrict: 'reject'` (fail-closed) or `'warn'` (default) proceed-with-
  warning. `robot_safety_arbitrate` runs the fixed-format VLM arbitration and
  flags any non-safe verdict for human arbitration.
- **Forensics**: a ring buffer of joint/torque samples is dumped to
  `forensics.dump_dir` on every CRITICAL lock, for post-hoc / VLM diagnosis.

```bash
# build the safety package (same colcon workspace as vlm/ and offscreen/)
ln -s <repo>/safety /tmp/vlm_ws/src/dsh_ros2_safety
cd /tmp/vlm_ws && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/setup.bash
```

The `safety_core` pure logic ships with a fault-injection self test
(`python3 safety/scripts/safety_core.py --selftest`, 12 scenarios) — no ROS2
needed to verify the state machine.

## Robot profiles & communication topology

**Design intent.** A robot's body (URDF links/joints, cameras, MoveIt groups,
zero-pose semantics) and its comms graph are costly to rediscover every time.
The plugin persists them as a **structured profile** (`~/.dsh-ros2/robots/<name>.yaml`):
register once on first contact, then load instantly forever after. For the
comms graph, full verbosity does not scale (a complex robot has hundreds of
topics/services), so the design is a **trade-off**: an *aggregate snapshot*
(light node/topic/service lists) plus *progressive learning* of only the
important nodes as you actually work with them.

| Tool | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `robot_register` (L2) | Collect body info (URDF links/joints, TF root, cameras, MoveIt SRDF groups, **auto-links the zero-pose calibration** and a generic **`safety` section** with URDF-derived limits) into the profile; auto-launches the safety monitor (`startSafety: false` to skip) |
| `robot_load` (L1) | Load the profile as structured JSON — the fast path, no rediscovery; empty name lists all |
| `robot_topology` (L1/L2) | Comms graph: `snapshot` (L2, aggregate lists), `learn` (L2, one important node's role/description + pub/sub/srv/act, strict schema), `show` (L1, read back), **`diagnose` (L1 — knowledge-augmented diagnosis: cross-references the learned knowledge base + snapshot against the LIVE graph: missing / new / drift / topic_drift)**, **`search` (L1 — efficient retrieval in the knowledge archive: reverse-lookup by topic / keyword match on name/role/description/connections)** |
| `ros2_zero_pose_semantics` (L2) | Calibrate zero pose via render + VLM + user confirm (arm/elbow/palm combos or free text); the profile auto-includes it |

Two bundled skills complete the workflow: **`robot-registration`** (first-contact
flow: ask name/URDF → collect → register → verify, plus the topology baseline
snapshot) and **`robot-retrieval`** (load the profile instantly and bring up
renders/diagnostics/motion from it, including the learned topology and zero-pose
semantics).

**How it works.** Everything is plain structured YAML under `~/.dsh-ros2/` —
`robots/<name>.yaml` (body + topology) and `zero-pose.yaml` (calibration).
`robot_register` snapshots the body; `robot_topology snapshot` snapshots the
aggregate layer; `robot_topology learn` appends one node at a time (idempotent
merge) as you discover what matters. `robot_load` and `robot_topology show` read
them back instantly — one call instead of N discovery calls.

**The knowledge base is consumed, not just stored.** `robot_topology diagnose`
(L1, read-only) is the entry point for **knowledge-augmented diagnosis**: it
loads the learned nodes + snapshot and cross-references them against the LIVE
ros2 graph —

- `missing`: learned nodes that are offline now (controllers/publishers down) — highest priority;
- `new`: live nodes not in the knowledge base (learn candidates);
- `matched[].drift`: per learned node, expected pub/sub/srv/act vs actual (a missing topic = a gone connection; a new topic = the node changed);
- `topic_drift`: aggregate snapshot topics vs live topics.

The `ros2-diagnostics` and `robot-retrieval` skills both start diagnosis with
`diagnose` and close the loop by `learn`ing important `new` nodes — so the
knowledge base improves with every session and every diagnosis gets faster.

## Bundled skills

| Skill | Content |
| --- | --- |
| `ros2-diagnostics` | Which tool to use when, narrow-down methodology, debugging "topic has no data" / message-mismatch / TF problems |
| `robot-state-vision-analysis` | Full pipeline: status → offscreen render → VLM → cross-check (includes Jazzy `Description Source/Topic`, URDF↔TF frame-name matching, `file://` meshes, view distance, `FM frames` signal, calibrated zero-pose semantics) |
| `robot-registration` | First-contact flow: ask name/URDF → collect body info + zero-pose calibration → `robot_register` → topology baseline snapshot |
| `robot-retrieval` | Instant profile load (`robot_load`) and bring-up of renders / diagnostics / motion; read & progressively learn the comms topology (`robot_topology`) |

---

## Configuration

| Key | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `rosSetup` | string | `''` | Shell prefix to prepare the environment, e.g. `source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash && ` |
| `timeoutMs` | number | `15000` | Per-command timeout |
| `rosLogDir` | string | `''` | Override `ROS_LOG_DIR` (helps when `~/.ros/log` is not writable) |
| `workspaceRoot` | string | `''` | cwd for `colcon` / `rosdep` when a tool omits `cwd` |
| `includeStderr` | boolean | `false` | Attach trailing stderr to successful results |
| `display` | string | `''` | DISPLAY override for GUI/screenshot tools |
| `screenshotDir` | string | `''` | Screenshot output dir (default `$TMPDIR/dsh-ros2`) |
| `screenshotCommand` | string | `''` | Custom screenshot command; `{output}` is replaced with the PNG path |
| `vision.provider` | string | `'mock'` | `mock` \| `gemini` \| `openai` |
| `vision.apiKey` | string | `''` | Your API key (user-supplied; never logged) |
| `vision.model` | string | `''` | Model override (e.g. `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`) |
| `vision.baseUrl` | string | `''` | API base URL override (OpenAI-compatible endpoints) |

> `rosLogDir` also covers ROS2 Python CLIs spawned by tools (`topic echo/pub`, `ros2 run`); additionally `runCommand` auto-falls back to a writable dir when `~/.ros/log` is not writable.

## Plugin split (7 packages)

Since v0.15.0 the plugin is a **pnpm monorepo** of 7 npm packages (per
[`docs/plugin-split-plan.md`](docs/plugin-split-plan.md), ISP-tightened): 51 tools +
4 skills preserved with **unchanged names and behavior**. Install the domain
bundles you need (or the `dsh-ros2` aggregate for the full set):

- `dsh-ros2-common` is a plain library (not a cordis bundle) — shared runner,
  parsers, toolkit and `scripts/robot_profile.py` (zero-copy).
- Cross-package runtime contracts stay unchanged: `/vlm/describe`,
  `/safety/state`, `/safety/set_lock` …; `safetyStrict` semantics unchanged.
- `dsh-ros2-vision` **fixes the npm publish defect**: its `files` include
  `vlm/` + `offscreen/`.
- The vision provider is an optional cordis service (`dshRos2.vision`);
  `ros2_gui_observe` (core) and `ros2_zero_pose_semantics` (profile) degrade to
  `VISION_UNAVAILABLE` when it is absent.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

- **`~/.ros/log` Permission denied**: ROS2 cannot write its log dir. Set `rosLogDir` (e.g. `/tmp/ros-log`); `runCommand` also falls back automatically.
- **A flood of `RTPS_TRANSPORT_SHM` / FastDDS SHM warnings in stderr**: harmless noise when SHM transport is unavailable (common in containers/restricted environments); tools drop it by default.
- **`ros2 topic echo` returns empty**: check `ros2_topic_info -v` for publisher count and QoS; sample transient-local topics with `--qos-durability transient_local`.
- **Offscreen render: "all parts piled at origin"**: URDF link names do not match TF frame names (see mesh essentials #3); check the node log `FM transformHasProblems(<link>)=1` first.
- **RobotModel shows no meshes (`Links` empty)**: on Jazzy you must use `Description Source/Topic`; the legacy `Robot Description:` does nothing.
- **`Could not load resource ... Unable to open file`**: mesh paths need absolute paths or a `file://` prefix.
- **Description missing after the publisher exits**: the URDF publisher must stay alive (transient-local only re-sends once to late subscribers; gone when the process exits).
- **`vision_bringup` missed some image topics (2/4 measured)**: fixed — it now refreshes discovery every `--refresh` seconds (default 10), auto-spawning bridges for topics that appear later and stopping bridges for topics that disappear.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
pnpm run test        # vitest (115 cases; CLI outputs mocked)
pnpm run build       # tsc -> lib/ + lib/types/
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): on push to `main` / PRs, runs typecheck/test/build on Node 22 and 24, and validates that the `pnpm pack` artifact contains the patch layer (`cordis.patch.yml`) and the build output.

Release workflow (npm & GitHub Releases): see [`PUBLISH.md`](PUBLISH.md).

---

## Roadmap

- [x] `vision_bringup` polling/refresh discovery (auto-bridge late topics, stop bridges for gone topics);
- [x] Zero-pose semantics: generic calibration flow (`ros2_zero_pose_semantics`, render + VLM + user confirm, 3-axis combos) linked into robot profiles;
- [ ] npm publishing (`pnpm publish --access public`, requires `npm login`);
- [ ] More ROS2 distros (Humble / Rolling) compatibility validation.
