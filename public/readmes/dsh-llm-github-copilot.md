# dsh-llm-github-copilot

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

GitHub Copilot sign-in for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness).

Sign in with your GitHub account and use every Copilot model your plan includes — GPT-5 family, Claude, Gemini, and more — inside DeepSeek Harness.

The harness already ships a `github-copilot` provider that can serve those models; what it cannot do is sign you in. This plugin fills exactly that gap: it runs the GitHub device flow and publishes the credential that provider authenticates from. Requests, model discovery, images, and streaming are all handled by the harness route, not here. See [`docs/adr/0002-narrow-to-credential-provider.md`](docs/adr/0002-narrow-to-credential-provider.md).

## Requirements

- **DeepSeek Harness `0.1.2-alpha.1` or newer**, with its bundled
  `@deepseek-ai/dsh-llm-pi-ai` route (mounted by default). This plugin writes
  the credential that route reads.
- A GitHub account with a Copilot subscription.
- Node.js ≥ 24.

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot
```

### From GitHub

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot
```

pnpm 10 and newer block git dependency build scripts by default. If installation asks you to approve the package build, add the exact package key it reports to the profile's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
allowBuilds:
  dsh-llm-github-copilot: true
```

Then repeat the install command.

After installation, register the plugin in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: llm-github-copilot
      name: '@lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot'
```

Restart DSH to activate:

```sh
dsh web
```

## Update

The DSH profile uses pnpm internally, and its lockfile pins the exact installed version. Re-running `dsh plugin add` alone may not pick up a newer release. Use either of the following commands from any directory:

```sh
# Using npm (simplest — no extra flags needed)
npm install --prefix ~/.dsh/profiles/web @lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot@latest

# Using pnpm
pnpm add --dir ~/.dsh/profiles/web @lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot@latest --no-frozen-lockfile
```

Then restart DSH:

```sh
dsh web
```

To confirm the installed version, open **Settings → GitHub Copilot** in the Harness browser UI — the version number is shown at the bottom of the panel.

## Sign in

Run the login command inside the Harness chat:

```
/copilot-login
```

Follow the instructions — open the verification URL in your browser, enter the displayed code, and authorize the GitHub App. The token is stored automatically once you complete authorization. Run `/copilot-status` to confirm the connection and see the available models.

To sign out:

```
/copilot-logout
```

You can also set the token directly as an environment variable (useful for CI or headless setups):

```sh
export GITHUB_COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN=<your-github-oauth-token>
```

**Supported token types:**

| Prefix | Source |
|--------|--------|
| `gho_` | OAuth token (`gh auth login`) |
| `github_pat_` | Fine-grained PAT (requires **Copilot** permission) |
| `ghu_` | GitHub App user token (VS Code client) |

`ghp_` classic PATs are not accepted by the Copilot API.

## Features

**Device-flow sign-in** — no token to create or paste. Run `/copilot-login`, or use the Settings page, and authorize in the browser; the credential is stored automatically.

**Automatic refresh, handled downstream** — the credential carries your long-lived GitHub token. The harness route exchanges it for a short-lived Copilot token, refreshes it, and derives your account's API endpoint (individual, business, or enterprise) on its own.

**Ambient token adoption** — an existing `GITHUB_COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN`, whether exported or stored from an earlier version of this plugin, is adopted on start so you are not asked to sign in twice.

**Settings page** — a dedicated **GitHub Copilot** section in the Harness Web settings UI (gear icon → **GitHub Copilot**) for signing in, checking status, and signing out. Models are selected under **Settings → Models**, in the `github-copilot` provider.

**Slash commands** — `/copilot-login`, `/copilot-status`, and `/copilot-logout` for surfaces without the settings UI.

## Selecting a model

Signing in publishes the credential; it does not pick a model. After signing in, open **Settings → Models**, add the **`github-copilot`** provider, and choose a model there.

## Upgrading from 0.4.x

Versions up to 0.4.5 registered their own `github-copilot-official` provider. That provider no longer exists. If your settings or sessions name it, switch them to the `github-copilot` provider — the model ids are the same. Your stored credential is adopted automatically; you do not need to sign in again.

## Configure

The plugin works with no configuration. The only setting is which credential
reference holds the GitHub OAuth token:

```yaml
- id: llm-github-copilot
  config:
    oauthTokenEnv: GITHUB_COPILOT_OAUTH_TOKEN   # credential reference / env var
```

Everything about models, endpoints, and request behaviour is configured on the
harness route under the `llm-pi-ai` settings section, not here.

## Develop

Requires Node.js ≥ 24 and npm.

```sh
cd /path/to/dsh-llm-github-copilot
npm run build      # concatenate source fragments → lib/index.js and lib/client.js
npm test           # build + deterministic artifact, i18n, and metadata tests
npm run check      # build + tests + npm pack dry-run
npm run deploy     # test → build → atomic deploy with rollback backup
```

Install the checkout into a local profile directly:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add .
```

After Host changes restart DSH; after Client-only changes a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) is usually enough.

## Rollback

`npm run deploy` keeps a timestamped backup before each install. To roll back, stop DSH and restore the wanted backup:

```sh
cp -r ~/.dsh/plugin-backups/dsh-llm-github-copilot/<timestamp> \
      ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/@lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot
dsh web
```

## Troubleshooting

**Model selector shows no GitHub Copilot group after restart**
The plugin loaded in a previous process that didn't pick up the new package. Restart `dsh web`. The stored token is preserved; no need to sign in again.

**Models appear but Claude is missing**
Your egress IP is restricted. Export `HTTPS_PROXY` pointing to a proxy that exits from an unrestricted region, then restart `dsh web`.

**`/copilot-login` times out or reports a network error**
Transient network issue during device-code polling. Run `/copilot-login` again to get a fresh code (the old one is invalidated automatically).

**`configurable provider "github-copilot" is already declared`**
This plugin registers no provider of its own — it publishes a credential for the harness's `github-copilot` provider. If no models appear, confirm you signed in (`/copilot-status`) and that the `github-copilot` provider is added under **Settings → Models**. Verify that your `cordis.patch.yml` uses `id: llm-github-copilot` and `name: '@lujianjun19/dsh-llm-github-copilot'`.

**Token expired**
No action needed. The plugin stores the long-lived GitHub OAuth token and refreshes the short-lived Copilot API token automatically before it expires. Only an explicit sign-out or token revocation requires a new `/copilot-login`.
