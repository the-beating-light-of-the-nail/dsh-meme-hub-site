> *Read the strata of a run.*

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

**A real minimap of the session trajectory for the DeepSeek Harness Web GUI** — it takes
the transcript's scrollbar seat and turns it into a scaled, colored picture of the whole
loaded conversation, with your own messages emphasised and clickable anchors beside it.

Not a tick rail. Every other conversation navigator draws one evenly-spaced dot per prompt,
which throws away the only thing a long agent session has too much of: *volume*. Here a
band's height is the row's **real rendered height**, so the map is a proportional
compression of the scroll extent — a 300-line answer looks like 300 lines, forty tool calls
look like forty tool calls, and the viewport lens maps 1:1 onto the scrollbar. What you get
is the shape of the run at a glance: where you spoke, how much work each prompt cost, and
where it went wrong.

## What the map shows

| Band | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Full-width blue** | your message (and steering) — always the widest, brightest, never thinner than 5px |
| Grey block | a model reply; block height is how much it wrote |
| Thin grey tick | one tool call |
| Green | a slash command |
| Amber | a model retry, or a turn cut short by the output cap |
| Red | a failed turn — or any tool/command row that reported an error |
| Horizontal rule | a compaction checkpoint: where the model stopped seeing the history above |
| Rounded outline | the viewport lens (drag it) |

The ragged left edge is the index: every blue bar is a turn you started, and the block of
agent work under it is what that turn cost.

## It replaces the scrollbar

The rail sits in the transcript's own scrollbar gutter and the native thumb is suppressed
while it is up, so there is one scroll control, not two — no layout shifts, because the
gutter stays reserved either way. It is a takeover, not a theft: the moment the map stands
down (Trajectory tab, no session, a transcript that does not scroll) the native scrollbar
comes straight back, and uninstalling restores it permanently.

## Anchors

Beside the rail is a column of clickable anchor dots — **blue for every message you sent,
red for every failed tool call or command**. Click one to jump there. The dot for wherever
you are reading stays enlarged, so the anchors double as a position indicator. Anchors that
would collide collapse to keep the column readable; failures never collapse, since they are
usually the reason you reached for the map.

## The clue wall

**Hovering a user anchor dot** floats the clue wall over the right half of
the screen: **every user message in the session — including the ones above
the loaded window** (read from the session's own export log) — packed
like an evidence board: every card takes exactly the size its content needs
(a one-word prompt is a small slip, a long one a tall note), flowing into
masonry columns so the whole session fits on one board whenever it can.
Each card is tied to its anchor dot by a bezier that tracks live as the
transcript scrolls; unloaded prompts get a dashed border, tag and dashed
string, and the message you came from is spotlighted. Only when the board
truly cannot hold everything do **↑/↓ pager buttons** appear. **Click a card** to jump — an unloaded one
chain-loads the missing history first. The wall retires when the pointer
leaves it (grace period), or instantly on **Esc**; clicking a dot jumps
straight to that message.

## Map scale

A small **近 / 中 / 全** switcher sits under the rail while it is awake:

- **近** (initial) restores the view from when the session opened — however
  much history has been loaded since, the map keeps that scale and slides
  with your reading position;
- **中** (medium) spans twice the initial view, loading the difference on
  demand;
- **全** (full) maps everything — pulling in any unloaded history first,
  with the same rail progress bar the unloaded jump uses.

The choice persists per browser. Zoomed scales are pinned: loading more
history shifts the window, never the scale.

## Use

- **Click an anchor dot** to jump to that message or failure.
- **Hover** the rail — it widens and shows a preview card for the row under the cursor
  (kind, `n/total` for your own messages, and the row's text).
- **Click** a band to scroll it into reading position; the row flashes when it lands.
- **Click empty track or drag** to scrub proportionally, like a scrollbar.
- **Wheel** over the rail or the dots to scroll the transcript.
- **Keyboard**: the rail is focusable — arrows nudge, PageUp/PageDown page,
  Home/End jump to the ends (`role=scrollbar` with a live `aria-valuenow`).
- **Double-click** to pin the rail open (persisted per browser).
- Older history loads by itself: scroll (or drag the lens) to the top and the transcript's
  own *load older* fires, the map rescaling as history arrives. The faint `⌃` above the rail
  just says *there is more above*; it retires once everything is loaded.

The map hides itself when there is nothing to navigate: no session, a transcript that does
not scroll, or a non-chat view such as Trajectory.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-strata
```

Or straight from the repo:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add "github:jsdvjx/dsh-strata#main"
```

Then restart `dsh web`. To remove:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-strata
```

## How it works

Pure browser half; the Node half is empty and no session data crosses the wire for it.
Geometry and semantics both come from anchors the conversation view already publishes —
`[data-conversation-scroll]` for the scrollport, `[data-chat-anchor-key]` per flow row,
`data-chat-flow-kind` for that row's registered Chat Node kind, `data-state="error"` for a
failed tool or command, `[data-composer-seat]` to stay clear of the sticky composer. It
contributes one entry to the frame-wide `shell.overlay` list slot, so it adds a surface
instead of replacing one, and uninstalling leaves the native UI untouched. The scrollbar
takeover uses the theme's documented seam — rebinding `--dsh-scrollbar-thumb` to
`transparent` on the scrollport, the same mechanism ui-sidebar uses — so both the WebKit
and Firefox rendering paths are covered and no stylesheet is overridden.

Rendering is a canvas repainted on a rAF, re-measuring rows only when the transcript
mutates or its scroll height changes — a plain scroll moves the lens and nothing else, so a
streaming turn does not drag layout through the map. Colors are read from the theme's own
`--dsw-alias-*` tokens, so light and dark both come out right, and `prefers-reduced-motion`
disables the transitions.

## Limits

- **The map covers the loaded window.** DSH pages older history in on demand; until it is
  loaded it has no layout to map. The `⌃` indicator is the honest signal that more
  exists; reaching the top pulls it in automatically.
- **Chat view only.** The Trajectory tab renders its own event ledger with different
  anchors; the map stands down there rather than guessing.
- The rail occupies a ~14px strip of the transcript's right padding, so clicks in that
  strip go to the map.

## Development

```sh
npm test                      # node --test over the DOM-free internals
node test/replay/replay.mjs   # headless-Chrome replay against a live `dsh web` (see the file header)
```

The geometry, caches and the history-load state machine are exported as
`internals` from `client.js` and tested without a browser; the replay drives
a real session through Chrome's DevTools protocol (scroll consistency, drag,
wall paging, load chains, session switch).
