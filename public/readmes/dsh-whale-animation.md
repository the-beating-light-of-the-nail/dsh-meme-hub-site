## Scope

- **Refined Dive**: restored from commit `65e1205d1fbf4b01997e6dfc099103b0f9717e37`.
- **Classic**: restored from first-published commit `95b06e3f0e6ea817d25858eb29f7064a233b3c65`.
- Both animated WebPs and both reduced-motion PNGs are verified by Git blob SHA-1, SHA-256, frame count, and timing.
- The timed director alternates `dive → classic` every 11 seconds. Explicit classic/original wording selects Classic immediately; thinking/reasoning wording selects Dive.
- Dark theme, 84/72/60 px responsive sizing, reduced-motion PNGs, offline embedding, and lifecycle cleanup remain supported.

Removed in v0.7.0: Spout, Sonar, Tool Run, Stream, Calm, Retry, all generated art sources, and their build pipeline.

## Install

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add github:LeemanCheung/dsh-whale-animation
```

Restart DSH or hard-refresh DSH Web after upgrading.

## Verify

```powershell
npm run verify
npm run check:browser
npm pack --dry-run
```

`npm run verify` regenerates only `assets/manifest.json` and `lib/client.js`; it never regenerates or re-encodes either original animation.
