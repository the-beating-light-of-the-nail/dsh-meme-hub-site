# dsh-whale-animation

Two original whale animations for DeepSeek Harness Web. Nothing else.

v0.7.1 supports DSH 0.1.2-rc.1 without the retired, unused client-runtime injection. Background tabs pause document polling and refresh immediately when visible. Windows and Linux build the same LF-normalized client, checked by both CI platforms.

## Scope

- **Refined Dive**: restored from commit `65e1205d1fbf4b01997e6dfc099103b0f9717e37`.
- **Classic**: restored from first-published commit `95b06e3f0e6ea817d25858eb29f7064a233b3c65`.
- Both animated WebPs and both reduced-motion PNGs are verified by Git blob SHA-1, SHA-256, frame count, and timing.
- The director plays one full Dive loop (1.980 s), then one full Classic loop (10.506 s). Status-text requests also wait for the current loop to finish.
- Dark theme, 84/72/60 px responsive sizing, reduced-motion PNGs, offline embedding, and lifecycle cleanup remain supported.

Removed in v0.7.0: Spout, Sonar, Tool Run, Stream, Calm, Retry, all generated art sources, and their build pipeline.

## Install

```powershell
dsh plugin --profile web add github:LeemanCheung/dsh-whale-animation
```

Restart DSH or hard-refresh DSH Web after upgrading.

## Verify

```powershell
npm run verify
npm run check:browser
npm pack --dry-run
```

`npm run verify` regenerates only `assets/manifest.json` and `lib/client.js`; it never regenerates or re-encodes either original animation.
