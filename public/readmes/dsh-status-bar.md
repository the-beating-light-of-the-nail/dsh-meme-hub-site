# dsh-status-bar · Know what your agent is doing — at a glance

> The native DeepSeek Harness bottom status bar packs everything into one long line — so much that parts of it get **truncated** on narrow windows. dsh-status-bar brings a **near-native status-bar experience**: a fully configurable 17-segment bar showing exactly the content you want — status, model, context pressure, token burn, **real-time generation speed**, cost estimates, jobs and queue — toggled and reordered in two clicks, with useful options like multi-line wrapping and per-model cost estimation. It replaces the built-in stats line and removes itself cleanly when unloaded.

## Overview

**The problem:** the native DSH bottom status bar is one long, fixed line — the more it shows, the more it overflows, and on narrow windows parts of it get **truncated**. You cannot see the current model, how full the context window is, how fast tokens are streaming, or what a session has cost — and there is no way to arrange that information the way you work.

**Who it is for:** power users and teams running DSH daily — anyone who wants live session telemetry without leaving the composer, and without running a separate monitor.

**What it does:**

- **Near-native experience, fully yours** — 17 toggleable, reorderable segments: status dot, model, title, workspace, agent preset, turns & steps, model/tool time, TTFT & decode speed, cache-hit rate, tokens, context pressure, live TPS, session time, cost estimate, jobs, queue, errors
- **Live throughput (TPS)** — a host-side projection folds every `assistant/chunk` event, so the speed updates chunk by chunk while streaming; no polling, no external live-stats plugin
- **Cost estimation with a user-maintained model price book** — per-model rates, per-model peak/off-peak schedules, **each message/step priced with the model that actually produced it** (input, cache-hit, cache-write and output priced separately at that step's own time), and a «Usage & cost» dialog with a stacked cost-trend chart (day / week / month), a paged per-step usage history (with a dedicated cache-hit column), and a total-cost hero
- **Zero-config default** — 13 segments ship enabled; everything else is a checkbox away
- **Useful options** — multi-line wrapping (so nothing gets truncated), live TPS, per-model cost estimation with peak/off-peak pricing, currency choice (CNY / USD), a quick-toggle gear menu, and a dedicated settings page with one-click reset
- **Clean takeover** — the plugin's bar shadows the built-in `stats` cell at lower priority: while loaded it renders, when unloaded the built-in line returns untouched
- **Bilingual UI** — client locale strings ship for English and Chinese, following the DSH locale system

## Screenshots

The status bar replaces the built-in stats line with near-native live session telemetry (status · model · turns · context · cache · TPS · session time · jobs · queue · errors), managed from a dedicated settings page — including a per-model price book with peak/off-peak pricing:

## Compatibility

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| DSH versions | `0.1.1-rc.2` (mainline `master`) — earlier RCs may work but are not verified |
| Last verified | 2026-08-19 |
| Runtime | Node ≥ 22 (host) + modern browser (client); no external services |
| Peer relation | Fully independent of `@linxin666/dsh-live-stats` (dsh-web-ui family): this plugin serves its own plugin-private `statusBarLiveTokenUsage` projection key, while live-stats serves the separate `liveTokenUsage` key. Distinct keys — the projection registry keeps both units regardless of registration order or `stateVersion`, so enabling both plugins never displaces the bar's live TPS |

## Install / Uninstall

### Install

```sh
# From npm (recommended)
dsh plugin --profile web add @bananiceee/dsh-status-bar

# Or pin an exact npm version
dsh plugin --profile web add @bananiceee/dsh-status-bar@0.1.9

# From a local checkout (profile assembly; `web` is a hardcoded alias for `--profile web`)
dsh plugin --profile web add ../dsh-status-bar

# Or from the GitHub repository
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Starlight-bananice/dsh-status-bar

# Or a pinned release tarball — immutable and versioned (attached to every
# GitHub release; handy when git access to the repo is awkward)
dsh plugin --profile web add https://github.com/Starlight-bananice/dsh-status-bar/releases/download/v0.1.9/bananiceee-dsh-status-bar-0.1.9.tgz
```
> **Note:** pnpm 11 enforces a 24h `minimumReleaseAge` for freshly published packages — if a same-day release is rejected, append `--config.minimumReleaseAge=0` to the `dsh plugin add` command.

> **Note:** pnpm fetches GitHub-hosted packages from `codeload.github.com` and does not read your git proxy config. If the install hangs or fails with a network error (e.g. `error (23)`), export an HTTP(S) proxy: `export HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890 HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:7890` and re-run.

> **Since v0.1.5:** the built `lib/` artifacts are committed to the repository — a git install is ready to run immediately, **no build step required**. Add the plugin, restart DSH Web, done. (Installs of ≤ v0.1.4 shipped no `lib/`, so they needed the manual build described under Development.)

```sh
# Or runtime injection without a restart (developer workflow)
#   dev_inject_plugin / dsh-super-injector → point at this repository
```

Then start/restart DSH Web. No configuration is required — the bar appears with its defaults.

### Upgrade

```sh
# npm installs: update straight to the latest registry version
dsh plugin --profile web update @bananiceee/dsh-status-bar

# or re-add a pinned version
dsh plugin --profile web add @bananiceee/dsh-status-bar@0.1.9

# github: installs — pnpm pins a ref-less `github:` dependency to the commit
# resolved at install time, so `dsh plugin update github:...` reports
# "Already up to date" and keeps the old build. Upgrade with a re-add:
dsh plugin --profile web remove @bananiceee/dsh-status-bar
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Starlight-bananice/dsh-status-bar#v0.1.9
```

### Disable

- **Hide the bar only** — the client master switch (Settings → Plugins → Status Bar, or the gear menu) turns the bar off instantly; the host projections and usage ledger keep running.
- **Stop the plugin entirely** — remove it from the profile's `bundles` list (equivalent to uninstall below); re-adding restores it.

### Uninstall

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove @bananiceee/dsh-status-bar
```

Removal restores the built-in stats line automatically (shadow cell released). **Data left behind:** browser `localStorage` (`dsh.statusBar.v1`) and the host usage file (see [Permissions & data](#permissions--data)) are not deleted — remove them manually if you want a clean slate.

## Quick start

1. Install (above), restart DSH Web.
2. Start a session — the bar shows status · model · turns · durations · speeds · cache hit · tokens · context · TPS · session time · jobs · queue · errors by default.
3. Open **Settings → Plugins → Status Bar** to toggle/reorder segments, enable wrapping, or reset.
4. Want cost estimates? Add the models you use to the **model price book**:

   ```sh
   # In Settings → Plugins → Status Bar → Model price book:
   # model "deepseek-chat" → input 2 / cache read 0.5 / cache write 2 / output 8 (CNY per 1M tokens)
   # optional: enable peak/off-peak with DeepSeek's official windows 09:00–12:00, 14:00–18:00
   ```

   The bar then shows e.g. `≈¥0.0123` for the current session; the figure is the sum of each model's usage × that model's own price (so switching models mid-session prices each part with its own rate). Click the chart button next to the gear to open the usage & cost dialog (stat cards, rate card, a paged usage history — 20 rows per page, up to 10 pages — with input / cache-hit / output / cost columns, and a per-model cost-trend chart with ‹ › period navigation).

## Configuration

All configuration is client-side, stored in browser `localStorage` under **`dsh.statusBar.v1`**, edited via the settings page or the in-composer gear menu.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | Master switch; `false` hides the bar entirely |
| `wrap` | `true` | Allow the bar to wrap onto multiple lines within the input card's width instead of eliding (the bar never runs past the input box's edges in either mode) |
| `segments` | 13 on / 4 off (see below) | Ordered list of enabled segments |
| `cost.currency` | `CNY` | Currency for cost display (`CNY` / `USD`) |
| `cost.models` | `{}` | User-maintained model price book (model id → prices + schedule) |

**Default segment state:** on — status, model, counts, durations, speeds, cache hit, tokens, context, TPS, session time, jobs, queue, errors; off — title, workspace, agent, cost.

**Model price book entry** (values added when a model is configured): input `2`, cache read `0.5`, cache write `2`, output `8` (per 1M tokens, in the configured currency); peak/off-peak disabled by default; when enabled, defaults to DeepSeek's official windows `09:00–12:00`, `14:00–18:00`, timezone `local`.

**Environment variables:** `DSH_HOME` (host-side) — base directory for the plugin's local data (default `~/.dsh`). No other env vars, no secrets, no tokens.

**Segment reference** (all 17, toggleable & reorderable):

| Segment | Shows | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Status | ● running / idle / error dot | snapshot `running` / `partial` / `lastAgentError` |
| Model | model of the latest response | `sessionModel` projection (host fold of assistant/message events) |
| Title | session title (truncated) | SessionSummary |
| Workspace | workspace dir name | SessionSummary |
| Agent preset | preset name | SessionSummary |
| Turns & steps | N turns · M steps | `sessionStats` projection (window-fold fallback) |
| Model & tool time | LLM · tool-call wall time | `sessionStats` |
| TTFT & decode | avg first token · tok/s | `sessionStats` |
| Cache hit | prompt cache-hit share (2 decimals, capped at 99.99%) | `tokenUsage` |
| Tokens | billed input/output totals | `tokenUsage` |
| Context | context-window occupancy % | `contextPressure` |
| Throughput TPS | live generation rate (default on) | `statusBarLiveTokenUsage` projection (plugin-private key) — folded from `assistant/chunk` in real time; block-aware estimation (~4 chars/token + block/role framing, re-priced at `block-end`, EWMA against burst flushes), exact once the provider reports usage; 0 while the session is not generating |
| Session time | wall clock, ticks while running | `turnTimings` |
| Cost estimate | ≈¥0.0123 (off by default) | `sessionUsage` projection — each model's usage × its own effective price (flat or peak/off-peak at `now`), summed across models |
| Jobs | running background jobs | `jobsBySession` |
| Queue | queued messages | snapshot `queue` |
| Errors | failed/retried/over-limit count (>0 only) | node fold |

## Permissions & data

| Category | What the plugin touches |
|---|---|
| Files | Host writes the usage ledger to `<DSH_HOME>/dsh-status-bar/usage.jsonl` (`~/.dsh/dsh-status-bar/usage.jsonl` by default; one record per assistant message: timestamp, model, input/cacheRead/cacheWrite/output tokens). In-memory history is a rolling 120-day window. |
| Network | **No outbound requests, ever.** The only endpoint is the plugin's own local webserver route `/status-bar/api/usage` (same origin as DSH Web, `127.0.0.1`), serving the chart buckets. |
| Credentials | **None.** The plugin never reads, stores, or transmits API keys, tokens, or cookies. |
| User data | Client: `localStorage["dsh.statusBar.v1"]` (bar config + price book — no conversation content). Host: the usage ledger described above (token counts only, no prompts, no messages, no file contents). |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause & fix |
|---|---|
| Bar does not appear | Master switch off → enable it in Settings → Plugins → Status Bar, or via the gear menu. `localStorage` cleared? Config resets to defaults. |
| TPS segment is 0 / blank | No stream has started yet, or the stream is between retries. The measurement window restarts on each `llm/retry`; the carried rate never goes blank after the first stream. |
| TPS conflicts with another plugin | None by design — this plugin serves its own `statusBarLiveTokenUsage` key; `@linxin666/dsh-live-stats` (if loaded) serves the separate `liveTokenUsage` key for its own UI. Distinct keys mean the registry keeps both units, so enabling both plugins never stops the bar's live speed. |
| Cost estimate missing | None of the session's models is in the price book (or they are all zero-priced) → add them in Settings → Plugins → Status Bar → Model price book. Costs are estimated at the book's rates (per model, flat or peak/off-peak), not provider billing. |
| Usage chart is empty | No assistant messages with provider-reported usage in the period yet, or `DSH_HOME` points elsewhere than expected (check `usage.jsonl` location above). |
| UI looks broken after an upgrade | Hard-refresh the browser (stale client bundle) and verify the plugin version in Settings. |
| Can't tell which version is installed | From the profile directory (macOS/Linux): `node -p "require(process.env.HOME + '/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/@bananiceee/dsh-status-bar/package.json').version"`. Behind `v0.1.5`? Re-apply the Upgrade steps. |

**Logs:** the plugin writes no log files of its own — host-side diagnostics appear in the DSH web process output (profile logs); client-side issues surface in the browser devtools console.

**Rollback:** the settings page has a one-click **Reset** (restores all defaults). For the plugin itself, uninstall → re-add the previous version with `dsh plugin --profile web add <pkg>@<version>`; the built-in stats line is always restored automatically on removal.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install            # devDependencies only (typescript / tsdown / @types); npm peers are provided by the DSH runtime closure and intentionally not declared
npm run build:client    # tsdown → lib/client.js (ModuleLoader bundle)
npm run build           # junction links + host tsc + client typecheck (needs DSH_CHECKOUT pointing at a dsh source checkout)
```

Build artifacts under `lib/` are **committed** (since v0.1.5), so plain git installs work without any build step; the commands above exist to refresh the artifacts before a release. `npm run build` / `typecheck:client` need `DSH_CHECKOUT` (or the common-path probe) — client typechecking resolves against the checkout's `lib/types` through junction links. Host-side sources are plain TypeScript (Cordis plugin), client sources are React + the DSH client UI slots.

**Keeping `lib/` in sync:** run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` (reproducible rebuilds use the exact toolchain pinned in `pnpm-lock.yaml`), then `npm run verify` before pushing (`scripts/verify.sh` rebuilds host + client and fails when the committed `lib/` drifted from `src/`). The repository also ships a pre-push hook that runs it automatically whenever a push touches `src/` or the build config — enable it once with:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The `lib-sync` GitHub Actions workflow enforces the same invariant in CI: a fast artifact-integrity check on every push/PR, plus a full rebuild-vs-`lib/` drift check on PRs that touch `src/` and on manual dispatch.

**Contributing:** fork the repository, branch off `main`, and open a PR — small, focused changes with a clear description are preferred. Report bugs via Issues with the DSH version, browser, and a minimal repro.
