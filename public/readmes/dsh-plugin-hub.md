> Manage all your DeepSeek Harness plugins in one panel: one-click enable/disable,
> a 500+ plugin & skill marketplace with one-click install, and one-click framework
> upgrade with auto-rollback.

## Why DSH Plugin Hub

- 🧩 **Plugin & skill hub** — auto-collected index of `dsh-plugin` repos (500+ by
  stars) plus a Skills tab; browse, search, one-click install, **zero GitHub API
  calls** (served via CDN).
- 🚀 **One-click framework upgrade** — backup → online install (service stays up) →
  verify → **auto-rollback on failure**. Tested end-to-end.
- 🤖 **AI Empower** — give the console a package name or GitHub repo, the local AI
  reads its docs and drafts a safe, confirmable deployment plan (install / config /
  start / health-check); server components get an automatic control card.
  → [details](docs/ai-empower.md)

## Install

```sh
# npm release (recommended: prebuilt, no git / build authorization needed)
dsh plugin --profile web add @noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-console

# or install from GitHub source (needs git; allowBuilds authorization on first add)
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-hub
```

Then restart the dsh service → refresh the page → **Settings → Plugins → Plugin Console**.

<details><summary><b>More install options</b> (deploy script / hand it to an AI)</summary>

### Option 2: deploy script (fallback when network is restricted)

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-hub "$env:TEMP\dsh-plugin-console" 2>$null; & "$env:TEMP\dsh-plugin-console\deploy.ps1"
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-hub /tmp/dsh-plugin-console 2>/dev/null; bash /tmp/dsh-plugin-console/deploy.sh
```

The script copies the plugin into `$DSH_HOME/profiles/<profile>/node_modules/` and
idempotently appends an enable entry to `cordis.patch.yml`. Afterwards:

1. Restart the dsh service (host code changes need a process restart; CLI restarts the
   process, the desktop client exits and reopens);
2. Refresh the page → Settings → Plugins → **Plugin Console**.

### Option 3: hand it to an AI in one sentence

> Install the DSH plugin hub (dsh-plugin-hub): run `dsh plugin --profile web add @noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-console` (npm release); if there is no dsh CLI, clone https://github.com/Noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-hub to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/` and register it in `cordis.patch.yml` (id: plugin-console, name: @noob-stupid/dsh-plugin-console). Restart dsh web afterwards.

Requires: DSH ≥ 0.1.0-rc.6 (web profile, with `dsh-client-modules` / `dsh-host-plugin-inventory`).

## Highlights

| | Benefit | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 🤖 | **AI Empower ** | Give the console a package name or GitHub repo — the local AI reads docs, drafts a **deployment plan** (install / write config / start service / health check) and executes it safely after your confirmation; server-type components get an automatic control card |
| 🛡️ | **Framework upgrade safety & adapt gate ** | Force-disables plugins incompatible with the new framework (enable locked; 「Check update → Update & adapt」auto-verifies and unlocks); full-tree checkpoint before upgrade, automatic rollback on relaunch failure, one-click rollback to the previous version |
| 🏠 | **Family-bundle cards & safety ** | Same-root subpath exports group into one family card (collapse/expand, batch check-update, one-click unlock-adapted, known-check preview); never-crash safety (pre-enable import probe + patch auto-heal + exports fallback); adapt-gate source-scan hard criterion & migrate detection; deleting a bundle sub-row disables only that row |
| 🚀 | **Server component cards** | Left-side floating card auto-aligned to the main panel: start / stop / status / **open Web UI** buttons, multi-server dropdown, collapsible |
| 🧩 | **Plugin & skill hub** | Auto-collected index of `dsh-plugin` topic repos (**500+** by stars) plus a **Skills tab** (`agent-skills` ∪ `claude-skills` ∪ `dsh-skill`, up to 300) — browse, search, one-click install, no GitHub API calls |
| 🤖 | **Auto-collection CI** | GitHub Actions reruns `build-index` every 6 hours (manual trigger available); authors just add the `dsh-plugin` / `agent-skills` / `claude-skills` / `dsh-skill` topic — no application needed |
| ⚡ | **Instant, rate-limit-free** | The index is served as a static `marketplace/index.json` via jsDelivr CDN (10-min host cache); terminal users make **zero GitHub API calls** |
| 🔄 | **Version detection & one-click update** | Semver-based; installed entries match npm `dist-tags.latest` / `beta`; subpackage mismatch warnings prevent mixed-version breakage |
| 🔀 | **Multi-source** | GitHub / Gitee (direct-repo mode) / custom search sources (URL template + header auth + private http); `⊞` merges GitHub + all custom sources in parallel |
| 🔒 | **Safe by default** | Loopback-only routes; AI fallback behind an explicit cost-consent modal; infrastructure rows are toggle-protected |

## Usage

1. Restart DSH → open the Web GUI → **Settings → Plugins → Plugin Console**.
2. **Installed list**: toggle plugins on/off (HMR applies within ~1s), search by name/id,
   expand details (version, repository, README summary).
3. **Marketplace**: empty query on the GitHub source opens the static index (instant);
   type a query to search live. Switch sources via the login pill (GitHub / Gitee / custom);
   `⊞` merges all sources; `★` filters to `dsh plugin add`-installable packages.
4. **Skills tab**: switch 插件/技能 next to the search box to browse and install skills
   (cloned into `~/.dsh/skills/<name>/`).
5. **Install**: click 添加到本地 → the chain runs in the background (safe to leave the page);
   「检测更新」/「更新 → vX」 appear automatically for installed entries.

---

## Features

### Installed plugins (one-click toggle + details)

- **Shows only third-party plugins by default** (extra/non-bundled), tagged
  "Third-party" with a delete entry; click "All" to see the full list (1.5s flash feedback);
- Lists every plugin entry (name, load state, enabled state); search by name/id;
- Disable = append `- id: X` + `disabled: true` to the user patch layer, effective via HMR;
- Enable = remove that entry; bundle-layer rows disabled by default are overridden with
  `disabled: false`;
- Tags "Patch-disabled / Patch-forced" distinguish user patch state;
- **Infrastructure protection**: host transport/hmr/storage/settings chain plugins
  (70+ rows) are marked "Protected" and cannot be toggled — disabling them would break HMR;
- **Details panel**: version, repository/homepage links and a README summary for each plugin;
- **Version check**: 检测更新 reads npm `dist-tags.latest` (curl channel, works even when
  node networking is blocked) and warns about subpackages that need syncing (depsOutdated).

### Framework one-click upgrade (deepseek-harness card)

- The **deepseek-harness** card shows **「框架升级 → vX」** when a newer framework version is
  available (stable `latest` preferred; `next` channel when `latest` equals the installed
  version); clicking runs the full flow: backup config + framework snapshot (rollback point)
  → **online install** (service stays up, page never disconnects) → version verification →
  **auto-restart to apply**;
- **Real-time progress**: a `DSH-Upgrade` console window pops up showing live pnpm download
  progress; the in-panel progress card shows the waiting time;
- **Upgrade protection**: failed installs **auto-rollback** (robocopy, backup verified before
  upgrade), version check catches fake success, 15-min hard timeout, stall detection
  (no debug-log updates → auto switch registry), global trap fallback, and 15-min stale-state
  cleanup — the framework is never left broken;
- **pnpm channel**: npm-cli.js freezes at startup in the schtasks task environment (0-byte
  debug log, no network requests ever sent); upgrades use `corepack pnpm` (starts in ~0.4s,
  installed rc.8 in 11.5s) against the **npmmirror (China) registry**, with
  `dangerouslyAllowAllBuilds` so native modules (node-pty/koffi) compile;
- **Runtime bin resolution**: under the pnpm layout `@deepseek-ai/dsh` is a Junction — the
  relaunch step resolves `bin.js` at runtime (follows the Junction to the current version)
  instead of using a path baked in at script-generation time;
- **Card dismiss semantics**: terminal states (done/failed) are permanently dismissed on ✕
  (persisted); in-progress dismissal is session-only and the card returns after a refresh.

### Marketplace (multi-source)

- **Source switcher**: click the login pill to switch between **GitHub / Gitee / custom
  sources** (persisted); title, loading text, placeholder and note all follow the source;
- **GitHub**: default query `dsh-plugin`, browser-direct with server fallback;
- **Gitee**: official search API is retired, so it uses **direct-repo mode** — enter
  `owner/repo` (Chinese paths and full URLs supported) to find and install a repository;
- **Custom sources**: add in Source Manager (URL template with `{q}`/`{page}` placeholders),
  optional **header auth** (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer ...`), and **local/private http URLs**;
- **Multi-source summary**: the `⊞` toggle searches GitHub + all custom sources in parallel,
  merging results with source labels;
- **★ official filter**: shows only packages installable via `dsh plugin add` — root packages
  with a `dsh.bundle` manifest (official) or aggregate repos whose **subpackage carries
  `dsh.bundle`** (subpackage-installable); markers are enriched by the server (curl dual-channel)
  with a client-side fallback;
- **Type badges**: 官方 / 聚合 / 技能 (repo contains SKILL.md) recognized automatically.

### Static index market (plugin & skill tabs)

> **Hybrid architecture**: browsing uses the static index (instant, zero GitHub API calls),
> searching uses live channels (GitHub search API / multi-source parallel) — they complement
> each other: a brand-new repo can be found by live search even before it enters the index.

- Empty query on the GitHub source shows the **static index** (`marketplace/index.json`,
  jsDelivr CDN + 10-min host cache): 500+ plugins by stars, instant, **zero GitHub API calls**;
- **插件 / 技能 tabs** next to the search box: the skills tab lists auto-collected
  `agent-skills` ∪ `claude-skills` ∪ `dsh-skill` repos (up to 300);
- **Auto version check**: installed entries in the market are checked against npm
  `dist-tags.latest` in the background — cards turn into **「更新 → vX」** buttons;
- **Skill install**: skill entries install by git-clone into `~/.dsh/skills/<name>/`
  (frontmatter `name` wins over repo name; SKILL.md found at repo root or first-level
  subdirectory). Installed skills show a grey 「已装」 badge.

### Source Manager

The floating "Sources" button (right of the title row, semi-transparent) opens the manager:

![Source Manager](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef712900-65ae-4f6f-9584-bacdd8d34ea1)

- **Install sources (registry)**: add / inline edit / set primary / restore defaults;
  private and intranet addresses supported; **deletion is protected** (install-critical);
- **Search sources**: built-in GitHub, Gitee + custom search sources (add/remove, `🔒` shows
  header count);
- **Gitee login (optional)**: direct mode needs no login; login only raises rate limits —
  create a third-party app (gitee.com → Data management → Third-party apps, scopes
  user_info, projects), fill client_id / client_secret, save, then authorize.

## Known limitations

- Host code changes require a **service restart** (the panel's restart button is
  watchdog-safe); client changes just need a page refresh;
- Live GitHub search depends on GitHub reachability (browser-direct + server fallback;
  during network-blackout windows retry later);
- Version detection works for npm-published packages; skill-type repos have no version concept;
- The static index is capped (500 plugins / 300 skills per build); authors bump their star
  count or wait for the 6h CI cycle to enter the index;
- Skills are discovered by `dsh-skill-filesystem` — if the current profile does not enable
  that plugin, installed skills stay dormant until it is enabled and DSH restarted.

---

## Help

- **Panel missing**: restart dsh → refresh → Settings → Plugins → Plugin Console.
- **Toggle does nothing**: infrastructure rows are "Protected" (by design); normal toggles
  take effect via HMR within 1-3s.
- **Compatibility warning**: a breaking upstream release arrived; see Compatibility.
- **Search empty/fails**: GitHub uses browser-direct (falls back to the server channel);
  Gitee is direct-repo mode (enter `owner/repo`); check custom-source URL/headers; retry
  during network blackout windows.
- **★ filter empty**: ★ shows only `dsh plugin add`-installable packages (official +
  subpackage-bundle aggregates); markers are backfilled in 1-3s — no false "none" report.
- **Install fails**: confirm the repo has package.json and the package is published; npm
  failures fall back to git install; switch the primary source if npmmirror is unstable.
- **Skill not found by DSH**: enable `@deepseek-ai/dsh-skill-filesystem` in the profile
  (`cordis.yml`) and restart; skills live in `~/.dsh/skills/<name>/`.
