One-stop SKILL & MCP manager — a **host-level plugin** for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) with MCP **on-demand loading**: no more worrying about too many MCP tools burning your tokens.

## Core features

### 1. One-stop visual management

Which Skills **and** MCPs are installed? Are they enabled? What does each one do? All visible directly in the settings page — **no digging through layers**. Enable/disable and delete MCPs and Skills from the UI, and click a SKILL to view its source (opens with your local default markdown reader).

### 2. MCP on-demand loading (the core feature, carefully polished)

At session start, an on-demand server exposes only its **name + short tool descriptions**. The AI knows each tool exists and what it does, without the full schemas. That means:

- **A balance between token bill and full context** — exposing only the manager means everything else requires a tool call to inspect, which risks the AI never realizing something exists and never going to check what's available; but sending the full schemas bloats the context. This plugin treats MCP and SKILL the same way: it provides the basic **name + description** and lets the AI decide what to load.
- **No startup latency** — the server connects only when the AI actually needs it.
- **No failed-load dead end** — loading is on demand, and a failure is non-fatal (retry / reload later).

### 3. In-session MCP hot reload

Updated your own local MCP server? Just `mcp_load` it in the session — reconnect, re-list tools, fresh snapshot. **No new session, no DSH restart — extremely friendly to MCP development.**

### 4. SKILL deep scan, external libraries, temporary hide

- Recursively discovers `<dir>/SKILL.md` at **any depth** — connect any number of external skill-library directories, at any depth, so you can group SKILLs flexibly. The plugin only scans `<dir>/SKILL.md`, so other files in a folder (e.g. `readme.md`, `reference.md`, backup files) are never picked up as skills.
- Hiding a skill = invisible to the model (writes `disable-model-invocation`), while your `/name` slash command **still works**.
- Delete moves the whole `<dir>/` folder to the recycle bin — recoverable when needed.

## Other helpful features

To make the plugin easy and reassuring to use, it also includes:

### 5. Native MCP config takeover — nothing lost on uninstall

On install it automatically takes over your existing MCP config: every `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client` row in the profile is imported into the registry and taken over (on-demand by default; already-disabled stays disabled).

Uninstall is safe: whenever an MCP is added, the plugin also syncs the MCP config into the original config file but keeps it **disabled**. `/mcp prepare-uninstall` flips those disabled MCPs back to enabled and hands every managed entry (with full config) back to the native client. **Removing the plugin never loses your MCP config.**

### 6. Your note on every MCP

Attach a user note to any MCP; it is shown to the AI in the session catalog and is **never overwritten** by server/developer updates. For example: *"If server A goes down, use server B as a backup."*

### 7. Auto warm-up

After install the plugin connects once to fetch real tool names and descriptions, so the catalog is immediately useful. The cache is refreshed automatically every time an MCP is loaded.

### 8. Validated registration

`mcp_register` **trial-connects + lists tools before persisting** — only correctly configured servers are admitted.

### 9. Profile-scoped only

The plugin only manages the profile it is installed into — no overreach, no misplacement.

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin --profile <profile> add dsh-skill-mcp-manager
```

Then add one row to that profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (see [`cordis.patch.example.yml`](cordis.patch.example.yml)):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: skill-mcp-manager
      name: 'dsh-skill-mcp-manager'
      config:
        dataDir: ''            # empty = ~/.dsh/skill-mcp-manager
        profile: web           # write the profile you want to manage
        trialTimeoutMs: 30000
        toolCallTimeoutMs: 60000
        catalogDescriptionMaxLength: 500
        toolDescriptionMaxLength: 150   # per-tool description truncation in the catalog (adjustable)
        importNativeMcp: true           # take over native dsh-mcp-client rows on boot
```

Restart the profile. The plugin lives in the Host composition, so its tools become available to every session in that profile.

> **Takeover note:** with `importNativeMcp: true` (default), native `dsh-mcp-client` rows are imported into the capability library and disabled at the native layer — the capability library becomes the single entry point (three tiers, `mcp-catalog`, the UI). Run `/mcp prepare-uninstall` before uninstalling to hand the entries back.

## Usage

### In the UI

Open **Settings → Capability**:

- **SKILL tab** — every managed skill (bundle `SKILL.md`), sorted by path: model-visibility switch, open in system editor, cross-platform delete. Skills shipped with the deployment (under `node_modules` / `app.asar`) are read-only: view + open only.
- **MCP tab** — every registered server with tier badges, tool counts and connection state: switch tier, inspect details (command / env / headers / tools), mask or reveal secrets, load / peek / disconnect, delete entries. A setting row adjusts the catalog's **tool-description truncation** (default 150 chars).

### Model-facing tools

The plugin provides three small, fixed tools to manage all on-demand MCPs.

- **`mcp_register`** — add or modify an MCP entry. Trial-connects (30s) + lists tools, then persists; the server's own description / version / title / website / instructions are captured automatically. Reuse it to change tier / parameters / notes; only connection-contract changes re-connect.

  ```text
  mcp_register { name, tier?, transport, command?, args?, env?, cwd?, url?, headers?, notes? }
  ```

  `tier` ∈ `eager` | `on-demand` | `disabled` (default `on-demand`). `notes` is user-maintained and is not overwritten by developer MCP updates.
- **`mcp_load { name, peek? }`** — load / hot-reload a server, returns full tool definitions + server-declared metadata. `peek: true` only reads the snapshot — no connect, no disconnect — handy when the AI forgot a tool's parameters and wants a quick peek without interrupting the MCP's live process. Especially friendly for stateful MCPs like browser automation.
- **`mcp_call { name, tool, args? }`** — invoke an on-demand tool (must `mcp_load` first). Structured `args` only — never shell text, never a temp file.

## Data

- `~/.dsh/skill-mcp-manager/registry.json` — authoritative MCP registry (version 1, `entries[]`).
- `~/.dsh/skill-mcp-manager/settings.json` — plugin settings (`customRecursiveDirs`, `toolDescriptionMaxLength`, …).
- `~/.dsh/skill-mcp-manager/trash.log` — delete audit.
- Env values may be literals or `$VAR` references to the process environment.

## Future directions

- **MCP Resources & prompts support** — currently only MCP tool calls are supported; other parts of the MCP protocol will be added later.
- Disable a single tool inside an MCP without affecting the others.
- Edit each MCP's note (notes) in the UI.
- View and edit SKILLs in the UI.
