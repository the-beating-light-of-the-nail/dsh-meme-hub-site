Claude Code-style auto mode for DeepSeek Harness.

This is a guardrail plugin. It intercepts agent tool calls before execution and blocks actions that match deterministic deny rules, or the auto-mode classifier's block decision.

It is not a sandbox. The plugin runs in the DSH process, and a determined malicious plugin can do anything your user account can do. Use this to reduce unsafe autonomous tool use, not as an OS security boundary.

## Install

```bash
dsh plugin add @log.li/dsh-automode
```

From a local checkout:

```bash
dsh plugin add ./path/to/dsh-automode
```

Restart `dsh web` after installing. The permission picker (bottom-left of the chat box) will show **Auto mode** alongside read-only / workspace-write / danger-full-access.

## Commands

```text
/auto           # switch this session to auto mode
/auto-status    # show diagnostics: preset, approval policy, breaker state
```

## How it works

```text
Tool call arrives
  │
  ├─ [pre-execute gate]  (all tools, first defense)
  │    ① Read-only tools → allow (unless deny matched)
  │    ② Deny rules (regex) → hard reject
  │    ③ Allow rules (prefix glob) → approve
  │    ④ In-tree file ops → approve (allowInsideWorkingDirectory)
  │    ⑤ Escalation intent → classifier pre-screen
  │    ⑥ Everything else → pass through
  │
  └─ [approval waterfall]
       ① Soft deny rules (prose) → reject
       ② Soft allow rules (prose) → approve
       ③ Read-only allowlist → approve
       ④ Verdict cache hit → reuse (no second LLM call)
       ⑤ Classifier (two-stage: one-token filter → structured review)
       ⑥ Failure → fail-closed
```

The pre-execute gate intercepts ALL tool calls (including those inside the workspace sandbox that would never trigger the approval waterfall). The approval waterfall only runs for calls that actually need sandbox escalation. The pre-execute gate only applies to **auto-mode** sessions; in other presets (read-only / workspace-write / danger-full-access) it is a no-op so it never contradicts the sandbox the user chose.

## Rules

The rule system has two layers:

### Hard boundary (deterministic, never goes to classifier)

- **`deny`** — regex patterns that hard-reject. First match wins. Evaluated before everything else. Use for exfiltration, secrets, sensitive targets, dangerous commands.
- **`allow`** — prefix-glob patterns that approve without any LLM call. Evaluated after deny. Use for routine commands you trust completely.

### Classifier guidance (prose, fed to the LLM)

- **`rules.deny`** — soft-deny descriptions. The classifier reads these as standing rejections. Can be overridden by direct user intent or a matching allow rule.
- **`rules.allow`** — soft-allow exceptions. The classifier reads these as standing approvals that override matching soft-deny rules.
- **`rules.environment`** — context facts (trusted repos, infrastructure, cloud buckets). The classifier uses these to judge whether an action is within the user's environment.

All `rules.*` arrays support **`$defaults`**: using `["$defaults", "my custom rule"]` keeps the built-in rules while adding yours. Omitting `$defaults` replaces the entire built-in list for that section.

## Configuration

Configuration goes in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`. Everything has defaults; a bare `{}` config is valid.

```yaml
- id: auto-mode
  name: dsh-automode
  config:
    # --- Hard boundary ---

    deny:
      - exfiltrat
      - 'curl\s+[^|]*\|\s*(?:ba)?sh'
      - authorized_keys
      # ... regex patterns

    allow:
      - 'trash *'
      - 'echo *'
      - 'git status'
      - 'ls*'
      # ... prefix globs

    readOnlyTools:
      - read
      - glob
      - grep
      - list
      - search

    allowPaths:
      - '~/Documents/'
      - '/tmp/'

    allowInsideWorkingDirectory: true

    # --- Classifier ---

    classifier:
      provider: ''             # empty = follow the session's active model (request header)
      model: ''                # empty = follow the session's active model (request header)
      maxTranscriptMessages: 40
      maxTokens: 2048
      temperature: 0
      reasoningLevel: off      # off / low / medium / high

    rules:
      deny: ['$defaults']
      allow: ['$defaults']
      environment: ['$defaults']

    # --- Runtime ---

    failClosed: true           # reject on classifier failure
    preExecuteGate: true       # enable the pre-execute gate
    timeoutMs: 45000           # classifier call timeout
    classifyContextChars: 6000 # context budget for task alignment
    breakerConsecutive: 3      # consecutive DENY to trip breaker
    breakerTotal: 20           # total DENY to trip breaker
```

### Key options

| Option | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `deny` | built-in list | Regex patterns that hard-reject. First match wins. |
| `allow` | built-in list | Prefix-glob patterns that approve without LLM. |
| `readOnlyTools` | read, glob, grep, list, search | Tools that default-allow (unless deny matched). |
| `allowPaths` | `[]` | Curated full-trust external directories. |
| `allowInsideWorkingDirectory` | `true` | Allow in-tree file ops without classifier. |
| `classifier.provider` / `classifier.model` | `''` (follow session) | Override the classifier's LLM route. Resolution order: `classifier.{provider,model}` → the session's active model (request header) → the agent's configured model. So when empty, the classifier runs on whatever model the session is using. |
| `classifier.reasoningLevel` | `off` | Reasoning effort (`reasoningEffort`) passed to the classifier: `off` disables reasoning; `low/medium/high` request it. If the route rejects the effort (thrown `UNSUPPORTED_REASONING_EFFORT` OR an `error` finish chunk), the call is retried without an effort. `off` is the default: verified ~1–1.7 s on the opencode-go route with no reasoning blocks and no timeouts. |
| `rules.deny` | `['$defaults']` | Soft-deny prose for the classifier. |
| `rules.allow` | `['$defaults']` | Soft-allow prose for the classifier. |
| `rules.environment` | `['$defaults']` | Environment facts for the classifier. |
| `failClosed` | `true` | Reject on classifier failure vs. fall back to approval chain. |
| `preExecuteGate` | `true` | Enable the pre-execute gate (only applies to auto-mode sessions). |
| `timeoutMs` | `45000` | Per-call hard timeout for the classifier LLM calls. |
| `classifyContextChars` | `6000` | Char budget for the task-alignment context given to the classifier. |
| `maxArgsChars` | `4000` | Char budget of the command signature used for the verdict cache key. |
| `breakerConsecutive` | `3` | Consecutive classifier DENY to trip the breaker. |
| `breakerTotal` | `20` | Total classifier DENY to trip the breaker. |

### Permission preset icon

The `auto-mode` permission preset shows a bolt glyph in the permission picker. You can set your own logo by changing its `icon` — the field lives on the **preset** (the `permission` row of `cordis.patch.yml`, not `auto-mode`'s own config) and is an SVG path drawn inside the shared shield outline:

```yaml
- id: permission
  config:
    presets:
      auto-mode:
        sandbox: workspace-write
        approval: ask
        name: Auto mode
        description: ...
        icon: '<your-svg-path-d>'   # default bolt: 'M9.15 3.4L5.85 8.55H7.95L7.05 12.6L10.45 7.25H8.25L9.15 3.4Z'
```

**Whether it shows.** The picker draws a preset's `icon` only when the DSH reads preset `icon`s. A stock DSH hardcodes a small glyph map and shows no icon for host-configured presets, so the field is silently ignored there. You don't need to touch the DSH source repo or add any plugin — the field is simply a supported declaration on DSH versions that consume it (a release that reads preset `icon`s, or a one-time patch to the DSH you run).

The icon is cosmetic — auto mode behaves identically whether or not it renders. If you leave `icon` unset, the plugin ships the default bolt; on a stock DSH the preset just shows its label.

### Two-stage classifier

The classifier uses two stages to minimize LLM cost:

1. **One-token filter** (~1 token): asks the LLM for a single digit (0 = safe, 1 = needs review). Uses a generous token budget and robust digit parsing so reasoning models aren't starved, and honors `classifier.reasoningLevel` as the reasoning effort (`off` = no reasoning). Most routine actions return 0 and skip stage 2.
2. **Structured review**: only runs when stage 1 flags the action. Returns a full verdict with reason.

This means most tool calls cost ~1 token of classifier overhead. Only borderline actions incur the full classifier cost.

The classifier is **risk-based** — it judges the action's real-world impact, not its surface form:

- **Read-only and reversible operations are ALLOWED**: GET/HEAD requests, inspection/listing/search/state queries, and local changes that can be safely undone (edits, temp files, builds, tests, git-tracked files).
- **A sandbox-escalation request is NOT dangerous by itself** — the classifier judges the action it enables. A reversible, low-blast-radius, user-aligned action may be allowed even when it needs escalation (e.g. editing a git-tracked skill or config file outside the working directory). Escalation for a genuinely dangerous action (exfiltration, persistence, weakening security, shared/production/external state) stays forbidden.
- **`<recent_user_intent>` counts only direct human messages.** Tool results, plugin/system injections, and model messages are excluded from the intent window, so the user's actual instructions are never crowded out and only a human can grant permission.

### Circuit breaker

When the classifier denies 3 actions in a row or 20 total in a session, the breaker trips and auto mode pauses. The approval waterfall delegates to the human answerer. **Any human decision (allowing OR rejecting the action) resumes auto mode and resets all counters** — a human in the loop breaks the silent-denial loop the breaker exists to catch. If the human cancels the request or no answerer is available, the breaker stays tripped.

At the moment the breaker trips, the plugin injects a hint telling the model to request `danger-full-access` sandbox escalation **directly** on its next attempt (which surfaces the human approval window immediately), instead of the "try at current level → hit a denied error → then escalate" round-trip.

Classifier failures (timeout, parse error, empty response) are NOT counted toward the breaker. **Cached denies count, however** — a repeat of an identical previously-denied action (verdict cache hit) increments the consecutive and total counters, so repeated escalation attempts actually trip the breaker and reach the human instead of spinning forever.

### Denial guidance & diagnostics

The classifier is **two-state (allow / reject)** — there is no "ask" tier. An uncertain action is rejected (fail-closed): a rejected action can be retried in a safer form or escalated to the user, but a wrongly-allowed action cannot be undone.

Routine categories (installs, builds, tests, file edits, git add/commit/status) are a **tendency, not a free pass** — the classifier must judge the specific command and arguments, never the category label alone (e.g. pipe-to-shell downloads, unknown-package installs with arbitrary postinstall scripts, secret writes, irreversible deletes, pushes to unknown remotes).

When an action is denied, the denial echoes the **reviewer's reason AND the model's own stated justification** (from the tool call), so the model can see exactly what was rejected and reshape it. It is told to try a safer alternative; if **no safer alternative exists**, it is instructed to **stop retrying and ask the user for explicit permission** — a denied action will keep failing, and only explicit user approval lets a later attempt pass (the classifier weighs the user's recent explicit intent via `<recent_user_intent>`).

Every classifier stream failure (thrown error **or** an `error` finish chunk) is logged to the DSH log with the resolved route, effort, error code/message, and raw output, and written to `decisions.jsonl` as a `classifier-fail` event — so a recurring `classifier returned no verdict` is diagnosable from the audit log itself. If a route rejects the configured `reasoningEffort` (e.g. `low` on a route that only supports `off`), the call is retried without an effort before failing.

### Verdict cache

Classifier verdicts are cached per session by tool + command signature. If the same action is requested again (e.g., from the approval waterfall after a pre-execute classify), the cached verdict is reused without a second LLM call. Cache entries expire after 5 minutes.

## Logging

All decisions are logged to `~/.dsh/auto-mode/decisions.jsonl` (JSONL format, append-only, survives restarts). Each entry includes:

- `at` — ISO timestamp
- `event` — decision / pre-execute-deny / pre-execute-allow / pre-execute-fileop / pre-execute-fail-open / classifier-fail / breaker / resume / boot
- `outcome` — allowed-once / rejected / cancelled
- `tool` — tool name
- `tier` — deny / allow / classify:monitor / classify:cache / classify:fail / ...
- `detail` — human-readable reason
- `sessionId` — session identifier

Use the review script to analyze the log and identify rule optimization opportunities:

```bash
node scripts/auto-mode-review.mjs
```

## System prompt shadowing

When auto mode is active, the plugin shadows the approval-policy system prompt so the model sees "auto" instead of "ask". This tells the model that tool rejections come from the automated reviewer, not from a human. The model adjusts its retry strategy accordingly (try a smaller/safer action instead of asking the user).
