## Features

- **PS-style Color Wheel** — Pick hue on the ring, adjust saturation & lightness in the inscribed square. Generates 30+ CSS design tokens in real time.
- **Precise HSL / RGB Input** — Enter exact color values numerically with instant bidirectional sync to the wheel.
- **Smart Color Extraction** — One click derives a theme color from your wallpaper by sampling the visible region, quantizing, and filtering out gray / near-black / near-white pixels. Video wallpapers contribute via an auto-captured frame. Fully client-side.
- **Eyedropper** — Hover the wallpaper to preview a color and click to pick it as the theme color.
- **Background Wallpaper** — Upload any image as your wallpaper. Drag to pan and scroll to zoom inside a viewport-proportional editor.
- **Video Wallpaper** — Use a video as a live wallpaper: muted looping playback that survives refreshes (file persistence + HTTP streaming with Range seek), with an auto-captured frame powering the preview, theme-color extraction, and the position editor.
- **Position Editor** — One shared editor for images and videos: drag to pan, scroll to zoom, one-click reset. Image and video placements are stored separately and never overwrite each other.
- **Layout Modes** — Fit / Fill / Stretch / Tile / Center for both images and videos; in Fit mode the editor-committed framing stays consistent across window resizes and cross-monitor moves.
- **Generated Dynamic Backgrounds** — Choose mesh gradient, Shader, or geometric patterns with adjustable spread, intensity, and seed locking.
- **Per-part Interface Opacity** — Independent sliders for the main background, sidebar, cards & panels (including the dropdowns and menus around the dialog), the input & controls (composer box, Cordis panel), plus the settings panel and wallpaper.
- **Per-part Interface Blur** — Frosted-glass `backdrop-filter` blur (0–60 px) for each interface part, including a real backdrop on the composer and Cordis panel via stable host selectors.
- **Conversation View Cards** — The message list is wrapped in a translucent card automatically, and the trajectory page gets whole-page opacity & blur controls, letting the wallpaper shine through the content.
- **Theme Export / Import** — One-click export to a self-contained `dsh-any-theme.json` (config + wallpaper, video embedded as a data URL) and import to restore it anywhere.
- **File-based Persistence** — All settings are stored on the filesystem under `~/.dsh/.dsh-any-background-data/`, not `localStorage`.
- **Bilingual** — Full Chinese / English UI with automatic locale detection.
- **Theme Watchdog** — Re-asserts the custom theme if the host resets it.

## Recent Optimizations

- **Video wallpaper end-to-end** — Videos are stored under MIME-derived names (`wallpaper.mp4/webm/...`) and streamed over the plugin's own HTTP route; they restore automatically after refresh or restart and travel inside exported configs.
- **Binary upload for large videos** — Uploads stream raw bytes over an HTTP POST straight to disk instead of a base64 detour through RPC (no channel body limit, any size works); aborted transfers clean up after themselves.
- **Video position editing** — The placement editor works on a captured frame reference with zoom/pan, adapted to all five layout modes; image and video framings persist independently.
- **Conversation view cards** — The message column gains an automatic card (border/radius/padding) and the trajectory page gets whole-page opacity & blur; switching views restores the previous host.
- **Boot flicker eliminated** — Theme tokens are injected through a dedicated `!important` stylesheet instead of inline `body` styles, surviving host theme service resets.
- **Color wheel overlap fixed** — The hue ring is drawn on top of the saturation/lightness square so the square corners no longer cover the ring.
- **Inspiration palette selection cleared** — Picking a theme color from the wheel deselects any previously selected inspiration swatch.
- **Debug telemetry removed** — Temporary boot-time logging and `MutationObserver` instrumentation have been cleaned out.
- **Per-part blur isolated** — Blur is applied on `::before` underlays so it never traps the host's fixed-position settings dialog.
- **New "Input & controls" part** — The composer box, slash menu, and Cordis plugin panel own a dedicated opacity slider; their translucent surfaces get real frosted-glass backdrop blur attached through stable host data attributes (`[data-composer-card]`, `[data-cordis-panel]`).
- **Native control contrast fixed** — Solid surface tokens (composer, menus, Cordis panel) now carry per-part alpha, and a forced `color-scheme` keeps native `<select>` popups legible — no more white-on-white when the wallpaper brightness verdict flips labels to white.
- **Translucency without self-damage** — The "Input & controls" opacity slider is deliberately decoupled from the settings panel's own controls (which share the same button tokens), so adjusting it can never bleach the plugin's own sliders and buttons.
- **Drag-time performance** — Opacity tokens are written as CSS variables on `<html>` instead of rebuilding the whole token stylesheet per tick; slider updates are coalesced to one rAF per frame; the main-background columns are only retinted when their own slider changes.
- **Drag-time wallpaper downscaling** — While any slider is being dragged the wallpaper swaps to a (~720px) low-res copy for cheap rasterization over large images, then restores full resolution on release.
- **Instant video playback on import** — A picked video starts playing immediately from a local object URL while its raw bytes stream to disk in the background; the persisted serve URL takes over on the next reload — no more upload + first-buffer wait after import.
- **Option boxes follow the card slider** — The dropdowns, slash-trigger menu, model selector, and popovers around the dialog now follow the "Cards & panels" opacity slider instead of "Input & controls"; the Cordis panel keeps its own input-slider binding.

## Installation

### Method 1: npm install (Recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background
# or, if published to the registry:
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-any-background
```

Then launch:

```sh
dsh web
```

The plugin appears as a **"Theme"** section in Settings.

### Method 2: npx (No Global Install)

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

### Method 3: Local Build (Development)

The `lib/` directory is committed, so installs need no build step. To rebuild after editing `src/`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background.git
cd dsh-any-background
pnpm install
pnpm run bundle
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add "dsh-any-background"
pnpm dsh web
```

## Compatibility

- **[`dsh web`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)** — Full support.
- **[deepseek-harness-desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/deepseek-harness-desktop)** — Supported; a known Electron packaging issue makes the left sidebar and center area opacity appear inverted — awaiting a desktop-client update to fix it.
