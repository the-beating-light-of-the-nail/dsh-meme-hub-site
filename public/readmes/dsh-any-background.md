## Features

- **PS-style Color Wheel** — Pick hue on the ring, adjust saturation & lightness in the inscribed square. Generates 30+ CSS design tokens in real time.
- **Precise HSL / RGB Input** — Enter exact color values numerically with instant bidirectional sync to the wheel.
- **Smart Color Extraction** — One click derives a theme color from your wallpaper by sampling the visible region, quantizing, and filtering out gray / near-black / near-white pixels. Video wallpapers contribute via an auto-captured frame. Fully client-side.
- **Eyedropper** — Hover the wallpaper to preview a color and click to pick it as the theme color.
- **Background Wallpaper** — Upload any image as your wallpaper. Drag to pan and scroll to zoom inside a viewport-proportional editor.
- **Video Wallpaper** — Use a video as a live wallpaper: muted looping playback that survives refreshes (file persistence + HTTP streaming with Range seek), with an auto-captured frame powering the preview, theme-color extraction, and the position editor.
- **Position Editor** — One shared editor for images and videos: drag to pan, scroll to zoom, one-click reset. Image and video placements are stored separately and never overwrite each other.
- **Layout Modes** — Fit / Fill / Stretch / Tile / Center for both images and videos; in Fit mode the editor-committed framing stays consistent across window resizes and cross-monitor moves.
- **Generated Dynamic Backgrounds** — Choose mesh gradient, Shader, or geometric patterns with adjustable spread, intensity, and seed locking.
- **Per-part Interface Opacity** — Independent sliders for the main background, sidebar, cards & panels (including the dropdowns and menus around the dialog), the input & controls (composer box, Cordis panel), plus the settings panel and wallpaper.
- **Per-part Interface Blur** — Frosted-glass `backdrop-filter` blur (0–60 px) for each interface part, including a real backdrop on the composer and Cordis panel via stable host selectors.
- **Conversation View Cards** — The message list is wrapped in a translucent card automatically, and the trajectory page gets whole-page opacity & blur controls, letting the wallpaper shine through the content.
- **Theme Export / Import** — One-click export to a self-contained `dsh-any-theme.json` (config + wallpaper, video embedded as a data URL) and import to restore it anywhere.
- **File-based Persistence** — All settings are stored on the filesystem under `~/.dsh/.dsh-any-background-data/`, not `localStorage`.
- **Bilingual** — Full Chinese / English UI with automatic locale detection.
- **Theme Watchdog** — Re-asserts the custom theme if the host resets it.

## Recent Optimizations

### v0.2.2

- **Dark host surfaces fully themed** — Message bubbles, setting-box inputs/cards, selectors, ghost/toolbar buttons, and module-platform surfaces now carry explicit dark tokens, eliminating white-on-white and white-icon-on-bright bugs across the conversation view, settings page, and interactive controls.
- **Refresh white-flash eliminated** — A theme-reset watcher re-asserts the plugin's forced scheme within the same frame the host re-applies its light `:root/body` rules; the `!important` token stylesheet survives host theme resets, so entering, refreshing, and set-changes no longer paint a white frame.
- **Brand badge & code banner contrast** — The sidebar brand badge and the code-block info banner now use dark surfaces with legible labels and icons.
- **Placeholder reads as a hint** — The composer placeholder is rendered with the weak caption token and italic styling, clearly distinct from real input text.
- **Dual harness compatibility** — `defineStore` is resolved through a runtime adapter that prefers the new `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store` and falls back to the legacy `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime/client`. A single bundle loads on both the npm release and the new deepseek-harness source, with no "missed the module table" boot failure.

### v0.2.1

- **Instant video playback on import** — A picked video starts playing immediately from a local object URL while its raw bytes stream to disk in the background; the persisted serve URL takes over on the next reload — no upload + first-buffer wait after import.
- **Option boxes follow the card slider** — The dropdowns, slash-trigger menu, model selector, and popovers around the dialog now follow the "Cards & panels" opacity slider instead of "Input & controls"; the Cordis panel keeps its own input-slider binding.

## Installation

### Method 1: npm install (Recommended)

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background
# or, if published to the registry:
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-any-background
```

Then launch:

```sh
dsh web
```

The plugin appears as a **"Theme"** section in Settings.

### Method 2: npx (No Global Install)

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add github:Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web
```

### Method 3: Local Build (Development)

The `lib/` directory is committed, so installs need no build step. To rebuild after editing `src/`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Tkingxiao/dsh-any-background.git
cd dsh-any-background
pnpm install
pnpm run bundle
pnpm dsh plugin --profile web add "dsh-any-background"
pnpm dsh web
```

## Compatibility

- **[`dsh web`](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness)** — Full support on both the npm release and the new source build. The plugin auto-detects which client-module table the host ships (the new `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-store` or the legacy `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime`) and resolves `defineStore` accordingly at runtime.
- **[deepseek-harness-desktop](https://github.com/anywhere-labs/deepseek-harness-desktop)** — Supported; a known Electron packaging issue makes the left sidebar and center area opacity appear inverted — awaiting a desktop-client update to fix it.
