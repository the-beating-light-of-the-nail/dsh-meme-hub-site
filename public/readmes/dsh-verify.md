*If Witness catches something for you, ⭐ [star the repo](https://github.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify) — it's how this project stays alive.*

**You asked an AI to build a web app. It said "done." Does it actually work?**

`dsh-verify` opens a real browser and checks — so you never have to take the agent's word for it.

![dsh-verify — Agents say done. The browser proves it.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify/7d4fb0bec3ae31f40561682a6d75d8a56f5a7ed5/assets/social-card.png)

![dsh-verify in action](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify/7d4fb0bec3ae31f40561682a6d75d8a56f5a7ed5/assets/hero.gif)

The quality gate for **agent-built web apps**. Works with any agent — DeepSeek Harness (dsh), Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Codex — and with any CI. You write what a human would check in a browser; a real browser executes it and returns a `PASS`/`FAIL` verdict with receipts (screenshots + diff images).

No LLM judges the outcome. **The browser is the judge.**

![Same task, same AI, two builds — only a real browser tells the difference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify/7d4fb0bec3ae31f40561682a6d75d8a56f5a7ed5/assets/wow-compare.png)

Same task. Same AI. Two builds. One missing CSS rule — the agent's self-review passed, a real browser caught it.

---

## Why this exists

We ran a 4-agent web team (spec writer → frontend dev → QA → reviewer). Their own review said:

> ✅ "All requirements met. No issues found."

In a real browser, the dark-mode toggle **did nothing** — the `.dark` class was toggled, but the CSS rule was never written. Every agent self-test passed because there was nothing in the page for the agents to run. **No one opened a real browser.**

That's the gap: *agents verify against what they believe they built, not against what a user actually experiences.* Unit tests and static checks can't catch a missing CSS rule.

| Build | What the agents said | What a real browser says |
|---|---|---|
| `demo/buggy` | "No issues found" | ❌ **FAIL** — background never changes |
| `demo/fixed` | one CSS rule added | ✅ **PASS** — theme flips |

Same page. Same JS. One missing CSS rule. Two different verdicts.

## Why not just ...?

| What you might reach for | Its blind spot | What dsh-verify adds |
|---|---|---|
| **Hand-rolled Playwright scripts** | Every agent project re-writes the same boilerplate; nothing is reviewable as a spec | A JSON spec is the whole contract — write once, reuse across agents and CI |
| **LLM judges (promptfoo-style evals)** | An LLM says "looks right" — it doesn't run the app or see the pixels | A real browser executes clicks, inputs, styles, and returns screenshot receipts |
| **Agent built-in browser tools** | They're the agent's *hands* — they share the same blind spots as the code they just wrote | dsh-verify is an independent witness, not part of the agent being tested |
| **Screenshot-only visual tools** | They catch pixel drift, not "button does nothing" | Behavior checks: click, expect text/class/style change, console errors, network errors |

The agent graded its own homework. dsh-verify re-grades it in a real browser.

## Use it three ways

| Entry point | What it's for | One-liner |
|---|---|---|
| **MCP server** | Your AI agent verifies its own deliverable, mid-session | `claude mcp add dsh-verify -- npx -y -p dsh-verify dsh-verify-mcp` |
| **CLI** | You or your CI verify a build/URL | `npx dsh-verify --spec demo/fixed.json` |
| **GitHub Action** | Every push runs real-browser checks | `uses: 263311487-ux/dsh-verify/.github/actions/dsh-verify@main` |

### From any AI agent (MCP)

```bash
claude mcp add dsh-verify -- npx -y -p dsh-verify dsh-verify-mcp
```

Then tell your agent, in plain words:

> Verify http://localhost:3000 — click `#dark-toggle`, then check `body` background-color changed. Screenshot it.

Tools exposed: `verify_spec` (run a spec JSON), `verify_url` (inline checks, no files), `generate_and_verify` (the AI drafts the checklist, real Chromium executes it), `health`.

### In CI (GitHub Action)

```yaml
- uses: 263311487-ux/dsh-verify/.github/actions/dsh-verify@main
  with:
    spec: demo/fixed.json       # spec file or glob
    # url: https://staging.example.com   # optional override
    # out: dsh-verify-out               # report output dir (default)
```

The repo dogfoods it: the [dogfood workflow](.github/workflows/dogfood.yml) asserts the fixed build **passes** and the buggy build **fails** on every push.

### On the command line

```bash
npm install -g dsh-verify          # or: npx dsh-verify
npx playwright install chromium    # one-time browser download
npx dsh-verify --spec 'specs/*.json'
# [PASS] specs/home.json (5/5)
# [FAIL] specs/cart.json (4/5)
#   ❌ expect_text #total: got "0" want "99"
```

## What's in the box

- **Deterministic judge** — a real headless Chromium (or Firefox / WebKit) executes human-style checks: click, fill, text, classes, **computed styles**, URLs, console errors, network errors, pixels.
- **Receipts, not vibes** — every run emits a self-contained HTML report with screenshots and red-highlighted diff images; `--json` for machines; exit `0`/`1` for CI.
- **Visual regression** — screenshot baselines, pixel-diff with thresholds (`expect_screenshot`), refresh with `--update-baselines`.
- **AI-drafted checklists** — `dsh-verify gen --url ... --prompt "..."` learns the page in a real browser, has an LLM draft the checklist, then executes it deterministically. The AI drafts; it never judges.
- **Multi-browser** — `chromium` | `firefox` | `webkit` per spec or `--browser`.
- **Zero framework lock-in** — a JSON spec is all there is. No config language, no SDK, no vendor.

## Example spec

```json
{
  "title": "my app",
  "serve": "dist",
  "browser": "chromium",
  "steps": [
    { "action": "goto", "path": "/index.html" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "#count-btn", "count": 3 },
    { "action": "expect_text", "selector": "#count-btn", "text": "Clicked: 3" },
    { "action": "capture_style", "selector": "#page", "prop": "backgroundColor", "var": "bg_before" },
    { "action": "click", "selector": "#color-btn" },
    { "action": "expect_class", "selector": "#page", "class": "dark", "present": true },
    { "action": "expect_style_changed", "selector": "#page", "prop": "backgroundColor", "var": "bg_before" },
    { "action": "screenshot", "name": "final-state" }
  ]
}
```

Top-level fields: `title`, `serve` (static dir) or `base` (target URL), `browser`, `steps`. Run many at once with a glob; exit is `0` only if **all** pass.

## The report

A self-contained HTML report — every step with a pass/fail badge, selector, and detail, plus screenshots:

![dsh-verify report](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify/7d4fb0bec3ae31f40561682a6d75d8a56f5a7ed5/assets/report-screenshot.png)

## Agent Arena — bring your agent

Real-browser benchmark for agent-built web apps: same 3 tasks, same human
checks, **open entry**. Run your model on the board in ~10 minutes:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify && cd dsh-verify
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
export LLM_API_KEY=sk-...          # any OpenAI-compatible model
node arena/run.mjs --agent "gpt-5/single" --task all --repeat 1 --submitter yourname
```

Your setup appears on the live leaderboard next to DeepSeek v4-flash / v4-pro:
[agent-arena](https://263311487-ux.github.io/dsh-verify/arena/).
Full rules in [docs/ARENA.md](docs/ARENA.md).

## Prove it (run it yourself)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/263311487-ux/dsh-verify && cd dsh-verify
npm install && npx playwright install chromium
npm run demo:fixed    # → PASS (11/11)
npm run demo:buggy    # → FAIL (exit 1) — the missing .dark rule, caught
npm test              # engine self-tests
```

The repo's own CI runs exactly that — engine self-tests, then asserts fixed **passes** and buggy **fails** — so the tool verifies itself on every push.

## Agent Arena — can agents ship working web apps?

Same task, same prompt, same human checks — different agents, graded by dsh-verify in a real browser. Latest run (2026-08-19): **44/48 runs passed** across 2 models × 2 strategies × 3 tasks, 4 runs per cell. Two counterintuitive findings: the pricier **v4-pro single-shot scored below the cheaper v4-flash single-shot** (10/12 vs 11/12), and a real-browser self-check loop lifted v4-pro to **12/12** — while v4-flash's self-check crashed once when its own verification report came back as corrupt JSON. Every failure is reproducible and invisible to an LLM judge.
