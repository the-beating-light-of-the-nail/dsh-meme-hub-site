## Why DSH OpenPencil

DSH OpenPencil connects [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DSH) with [OpenPencil](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/openpencil) so an Agent drives a real, editable, interactive design canvas instead of returning a generated image.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🖼️ Exact Multi-Frame Previews

The installed OpenPencil headless exporter renders design-faithful previews: the first top-level frame as a large replay-safe PNG, plus a horizontally scrollable thumbnail rail, click-to-select, and previous/next navigation for multi-frame documents.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🗺️ Interactive Canvas

"Open interactive canvas" lazily mounts the read-only OpenPencil Web SDK with pan, zoom, and fit — inspect any page, nested node, or inactive page without leaving the conversation.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### ✏️ Managed Editor

With `editable: true`, the edit action opens the managed OpenPencil editor — selection, layers, properties, drawing tools, undo/redo, and explicit save semantics — in a resizable right-hand workbench with a full-screen option.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🤖 Agent-Native Design Tools

Five direct-canvas tools plus six `openpencil_pipeline_*` tools let the Agent create, inspect, refine, publish, modify, and read a real canvas through managed OpenPencil runtimes.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🔐 Capability-Gated Grants

Image and document grants are signed, hash-bound capabilities. Browser metadata never exposes an arbitrary host path, and signed preview/editor capabilities never enter the canonical tool result or model context.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### ⚡ Transactional Safety

A full-pipeline document stays in a private unpublished draft until every native and DSH quality gate passes. Publication never overwrites an existing path, and aborts or failed batches leave no empty target behind.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🌍 Follows DSH Look & Feel

The tool card and managed editor follow DSH's Chinese/English locale and light/dark theme without reloading the editing session.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🎯 One Complete Workflow

"Requirement → private draft → semantic batches → exact PNG review and repairs → quality-gated atomic publish" — one complete loop inside DSH.

## Install into DSH

DSH is a separate package. Install it once if you do not already have it:

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh@latest
```

Then add the plugin to a profile and start the web app:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @zseven-w/dsh-openpencil@latest
dsh web
```

For local development, build the checkout, link its absolute path into the Web profile, and then restart DSH:

```sh
pnpm run build
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-openpencil
dsh web
```

The `link:` dependency exposes subsequent rebuilds from this checkout, but DSH must be fully restarted after replacing the profile dependency because the shipped Web profile does not hot-reload host bundles by default.

Prefer not to install DSH globally? Run the same two steps through `pnpm dlx`:

```sh
pnpm dlx --package=@deepseek-ai/dsh@latest dsh plugin --profile web add @zseven-w/dsh-openpencil@latest
pnpm dlx --package=@deepseek-ai/dsh@latest dsh web
```

> The OpenPencil plugin is public and requires no npm token. If the DSH prerelease itself requires registry authentication, keep that credential in a user-level or temporary npm config outside the checkout. This repository intentionally contains no registry credentials.

## Design Tools

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `openpencil_new` | Compatible fast path for simple jobs: runs one transactional QuickJS `batch_design` script, publishes with create-if-absent semantics, and returns an editable presentation. Prefer the full pipeline below for production design. |
| `openpencil_pipeline_begin` | Starts an owner-scoped private draft for a new workspace-relative `.op` path; the target file remains unpublished and untouched. |
| `openpencil_pipeline_context` | Loads the native dynamic design-agent prompt together with relevant guidelines, style guides, variables/themes, and UI-kit metadata or script references. |
| `openpencil_pipeline_batch` | Applies serialized semantic QuickJS batches to the draft; build the skeleton first, then add and refine sections. |
| `openpencil_pipeline_inspect` | Runs native quality or resolved-layout inspection, or creates an exact PNG that the model can open with image reading and review visually. |
| `openpencil_pipeline_finish` | Runs native finalization, lint, layout, screenshot freshness, and DSH quality gates, then atomically publishes with `createIfAbsent` and returns an editable presentation. |
| `openpencil_pipeline_abort` | Discards the unpublished draft without creating the target file. |
| `openpencil_create` | Applies a transactional `batch_design` program to generate or restructure nodes on an existing live canvas. |
| `openpencil_edit` | Modifies an explicit node or the single node selected by the user. |
| `openpencil_render` | Creates an immutable, content-addressed `.op` snapshot and renders every top-level frame on the active page — optional `scale` and `editable`. |
| `openpencil_selection` | Reads the exact nodes selected in the live editor canvas. |

## Agent Design Workflow

For production design, use `openpencil_pipeline_begin` → `openpencil_pipeline_context` → repeated `openpencil_pipeline_batch` and `openpencil_pipeline_inspect` calls → `openpencil_pipeline_finish`. The draft daemon is private to the owning DSH session, and the requested workspace path does not exist until publication succeeds. Intermediate draft screenshots never expose an editable sidebar, preventing user edits from racing the Agent's batches; editability is granted only after publication.

Context is dynamic rather than a static template: it combines OpenPencil's native design-agent prompt with the relevant guidelines, style guides, variables/themes, and UI kits. Build a structural skeleton first, then add content and refinement in semantic section batches. Successful batch calls return only compact layout diagnostics for speed; request the full resolved layout through `openpencil_pipeline_inspect` when needed. At minimum, call `openpencil_pipeline_inspect` with `kind: "screenshot"` after the signature/heading is established and again after the primary task or form plus CTA is in place. At each milestone the model opens the exact PNG with image reading, fixes visible clipping, overflow, hierarchy, spacing, control proportions, contrast, and text legibility, and repeats as needed; visual review does not happen automatically.

Finishing runs OpenPencil's native finalization, lint, and layout checks plus DSH's quality gate. These deterministic checks do not create taste or visual polish. After finalization, take a separate new exact screenshot and have the model review it visually; intermediate milestone screenshots can never satisfy this post-final freshness gate. Only then does the final finish call atomically create the target with `createIfAbsent`. A failed gate or `openpencil_pipeline_abort` leaves the target absent. Every published generation result is one presentation containing the exact final PNG preview and a document-scoped editable grant; it auto-opens the sidebar only when idle, never replaces another session's editor, and always keeps **Edit canvas** for an explicit switch. A nested `openpencil_pipeline_finish` result returned through PTC/Code Mode preserves that same presentation and never degrades into ordinary JSON or a read-only card. Historical or hydrated cards never auto-open.

Within the same running DSH service, switching browsers or reloading can recover a strictly parsed durable publication from `openpencil_new` or `openpencil_pipeline_finish` as the exact PNG plus an explicit **Edit canvas** action. A historical card never auto-opens the sidebar; the user must click that action. An ordinary historical `openpencil_render` remains read-only, and non-loopback connections never receive an editor grant.

The bundled `openpencil-design` skill remains the scripting and quality guide, and the managed runtime does not depend on the desktop binary. `openpencil_new` remains a compatible single-batch fast path for simple work, but production-quality generation should prefer the full pipeline.

Use `openpencil_create` and `openpencil_edit` only for an existing live canvas. Their edits remain unsaved until the editor Save action.

## Web Viewer Assets

DSH serves only `client.js` for a client plugin, so the OpenPencil ESM SDK, its WASM, and CanvasKit are staged as explicit same-origin assets:

```sh
pnpm run sync:viewer-assets
```

The sync command prefers a sibling `../openpencil` checkout (local development), falling back to the vendored `vendor/openpencil` submodule (CI and fresh clones). Override it with `OPENPENCIL_ROOT` or `--openpencil-root`. A complete prebuilt asset directory can be selected with `DSH_OPENPENCIL_VIEWER_SOURCE`. Runtime lookup can be overridden with `DSH_OPENPENCIL_VIEWER_ASSET_DIR`.

Viewer assets are lazy-loaded only after the user opens the canvas. If they are absent or invalid, PNG preview remains available and no canvas button is advertised.

## Managed Editor

Editable sessions use OpenPencil's managed web host — the same architecture used by `op-vscode`. The plugin starts the host only after an authorized user action, keeps the daemon token in memory, validates iframe source and origin, and closes the process when the editor session ends. The editor surface is selected progressively: native Tool details when the host declares that seam, otherwise the plugin's right-hand workbench with resize and full-screen controls.

Startup uses a slow-mount-safe listening handshake: readiness probes begin only after the bundled host announces its bound address. No desktop OpenPencil installation is required.

Published installations provide six native package targets: `darwin-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `linux-x64`, `win32-arm64`, and `win32-x64`; both Linux packages target glibc. The root package declares every platform package under exact-version `optionalDependencies`, allowing npm to select the matching package by OS and CPU. Each platform package stages `op-host-web-server`, the editor web bundle, and CanvasKit as one matching atomic runtime. The managed editor therefore does not depend on `/Applications/OpenPencil.app`, `openpencil-desktop` on `PATH`, or an OpenPencil source checkout.

If DSH reloads or unloads the plugin while the canvas is dirty, the host keeps an opaque local recovery draft for up to seven days. Reopening the same source asks before restoring it into the live canvas; recovery never overwrites the `.op` file until the user explicitly saves.

Official six-platform packages receive their China and Global collaboration bootstrap endpoints during the protected release build, which validates the injected endpoints before publishing. A local self-build without that injection may override the bootstrap before starting DSH with `OPENPENCIL_COLLAB_BOOTSTRAP_URL=https://<your-host>/api/v1/collaboration/bootstrap`; the value must use `https` and exactly the `/api/v1/collaboration/bootstrap` path.

Cross-device canvas synchronization requires both the PC/DSH native runtime and the mobile app to be updated to the same OpenPencil release line that includes the current collaboration queue fix. Mixing an older mobile app with a newer PC runtime may still show remote cursors while failing to receive canvas commits.

When developing from this repository, build the editor Web bundle, build the native host, and then stage that matching runtime before launching DSH.

`pnpm run build:editor-web` runs OpenPencil's supported WASM bundle gate. It requires Bash, Cargo/Rust with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, the `wasm-bindgen` CLI, Binaryen's `wasm-opt`, Node.js, and `gzip`; CanvasKit does not require EMSDK. The Web build does not use the collaboration bootstrap build variables. Before `pnpm run build:editor-runtime`, set both `OPENPENCIL_BUILD_COLLAB_BOOTSTRAP_URL_CN` and `OPENPENCIL_BUILD_COLLAB_BOOTSTRAP_URL_GLOBAL`; they are used only by the native Cargo build, which fails closed if either is missing. After both builds succeed, stage the runtime with the final command below.

```sh
pnpm run build:editor-web
pnpm run build:editor-runtime
pnpm run stage:editor-runtime
```

For a local, non-production smoke without the protected release bootstrap URLs, build the native host directly and stage it after the Web bundle. This validates the exact preview, MCP, and managed-editor paths; collaboration still requires an explicit runtime bootstrap override or an official release package.

```sh
cargo build --manifest-path vendor/openpencil/Cargo.toml --locked --release -p op-host-web-server
pnpm run stage:editor-runtime
```

Explicit runtime overrides are accepted only as one complete, matching set:

- `DSH_OPENPENCIL_EDITOR_BINARY` for `op-host-web-server`;
- `DSH_OPENPENCIL_EDITOR_WEB_BUNDLE_DIR` for the built editor web bundle;
- `DSH_OPENPENCIL_EDITOR_CANVASKIT_DIR` for the CanvasKit assets.

Providing only part of the set is invalid; the plugin does not combine custom paths with packaged runtime assets.

Saves use an optimistic source hash, an atomic replace, and a successor capability. If the source changes outside the editor, the plugin reports a conflict instead of overwriting it.

## Result Metadata

The model-visible result stays plain JSON. Browser-only `presentationMeta.$dshOpenPencil` carries additive grants for:

- `image`: PNG path, preview/download URLs, and real width/height;
- `frames`: every exact-rendered top-level frame in active-page order, including its node id/name/index and signed PNG URLs;
- `document`: source action path plus immutable snapshot URL, bytes, and SHA-256;
- `viewer`: revisioned SDK/WASM/CanvasKit URLs when the asset route is attached;
- `editor`: scoped launch/refresh capabilities when `editable: true` is authorized.

The result also records `renderer`, `rendererBinary`, `fidelity`, and any warnings. Existing PNG-only schema-v1 messages remain renderable.

DSH `0.1.1-rc.2` does not persist browser presentation metadata for tools nested under PTC/Code Mode. The plugin recovers that UI-only projection through a same-origin, session-bound endpoint: the browser sends only the session id, call id, and immutable document SHA-256, while the host resolves the authoritative result from the durable DSH session log and uses a short-lived in-process marker only to authorize recent live editing. Signed preview/editor capabilities never enter the canonical tool result or model context. Durable ordinary `openpencil_render` history remains read-only. A strictly parsed durable publication from `openpencil_new` or `openpencil_pipeline_finish` may receive a loopback-only editor grant only after an explicit user click; automatic sidebar opening is reserved for recent, trusted live results.

For bounded replay, nested metadata recovery accepts up to 128 top-level frames; larger Code Mode results remain available through their canonical JSON fallback.

## Current Limits

- Follow-up edits to an existing canvas require an already-open managed editor. Changes remain unsaved until the user invokes its Save action.
- The lightweight Web SDK canvas is read-only; full editing uses the separate managed editor surface. On DSH `0.1.1-rc.2`, the plugin uses the resizable right workbench with a full-screen option.
- The exact gallery covers top-level frames on the active page; the interactive canvas remains the way to inspect inactive pages and nested nodes.
- Render and snapshot caches still need a product-level retention policy.

## Build and Verify

```sh
pnpm run sync:viewer-assets
pnpm run build
pnpm run test:viewer-assets
pnpm run test:client
pnpm run test:host /absolute/path/to/design.op 375 1091
```

Builds require Node 24.11 or newer and pnpm. DSH host/client packages are peer dependencies supplied by the target DSH profile. Build tools are resolved from local dev dependencies, the active linked DSH checkout, or an installed DSH source bundle; `DSH_SOURCE_ROOT` can select a source checkout explicitly. The lockfile pins standalone public build tooling when that environment is provisioned separately.

For a private DSH prerelease, keep the issued npm credential outside this repository (for example in a user-level or temporary `.npmrc`) and run the requested version directly:

```sh
pnpm dlx --package=@deepseek-ai/dsh@latest dsh web
```

Never commit `.npmrc`, `NPM_TOKEN`, or copied registry credentials. This repository ignores local npm configuration by default.

`test:host` performs a real exact render, validates PNG IHDR geometry and SHA-256, exercises immutable image/document capabilities over HTTP, starts the staged managed editor, pushes a live selection, applies an MCP mutation, saves, and proves that the latest bytes reopen. The expected dimensions are fixture-specific.

## Ecosystem

DSH OpenPencil is the DeepSeek Harness plugin for **[OpenPencil](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/openpencil)** — the world's first open-source AI-native vector design tool — and part of the **[ZSeven-W](https://github.com/ZSeven-W)** family of pure-Rust, AI-native tools.

| Project | What it is |
| ------- | ---------- |
| **[OpenPencil](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/openpencil)** | The design tool this plugin drives — prompt-to-canvas generation, concurrent agent teams, design-as-code `.op` files, and a built-in MCP server. The exact previews, interactive canvas, and managed editor here are powered by OpenPencil itself. |
| **[agent-rs](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/agent-rs)** | A pure-Rust async runtime for shipping LLM agents — multi-provider, tool-capable end-to-end, structured permissions, real MCP, zero `unsafe`. Powers OpenPencil's built-in agent runtime. |
| **[jian](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/jian)** | Pure-Rust, GPU-Skia UI framework — widgets, layout, events, and hot reload in one stack. OpenPencil's UI framework, and the source of this plugin's fallback renderer. |
| **[Zode](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/zode)** | Open-source, AI-native coding assistant for your terminal — reads your code, runs commands, and drives OpenPencil over MCP. |
| **[noema](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/noema)** | Local-first, non-vector memory system for coding agents — durable memory as inspectable files, works across runtimes. |
| **[openpencil-skill](https://github.com/ZSeven-W/openpencil-skill)** | The LLM skill plugin that teaches AI agents how to design with `op` — a companion to this DSH plugin. |
