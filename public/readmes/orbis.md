# Orbis

English | [简体中文](./README.zh.md)

Orbis is a remote control client for Deepseek Harness (DSH).

The Orbis plugin provides device pairing, end-to-end encrypted transport, and real-time
updates across multiple devices.

## Getting Started

1. Download the Orbis app. It is currently in beta. [iOS: Join TesFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3Nqcbpns). [Android APK](https://github.com/icodesign/orbis/releases/download/%40orbisapp%2Fremote-dsh%400.2.9/orbis-android-20260908T011113Z.apk).
2. Install the Orbis plugin into DSH.

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add @orbisapp/remote-dsh@latest
```

3. Configure the plugin and pair your device from the DSH web plugin page (Settings - Plugins - Orbis tab).

## Development

Install dependencies at the repository root, then use a single command to build the plugin,
install it into your local DSH Web profile, and start the test page:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run serve:dsh
```

The page is served at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default. Pass flags to change the port or
point at a specific test directory:

```sh
pnpm run serve:dsh --port 3090
pnpm run serve:dsh --workspace-root /path/to/workspace
pnpm run serve:dsh --help
```

## Testing

```sh
pnpm run check:core   # typecheck + tests for everything that builds from this repository alone
pnpm run check:dsh    # typechecks and tests the plugin and client entry points against the public DSH SDK
```

CI runs `check:core` on every push and every pull request, and again before a release.
`check:dsh` uses the public `@deepseek-ai/*` SDK packages installed by the workspace.

## Releasing

Releases are driven by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Ship every
user-visible change with a changeset and commit it alongside the change:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

Changesets maintains one draft release pull request containing all pending changesets. Keep that
pull request open while changes accumulate. When the complete release is ready, review the combined
version and changelog, mark the pull request as ready, and merge it to publish the release. Changes
that do not affect a published package do not need a changeset.

Write release-level highlights and upgrade notes in `.changeset/.release-notes/next.md`, using
heading level 3 (`###`) or lower. The version script prepends that Markdown to the generated package
changelog, so the draft release pull request and final GitHub Release show the same notes before the
Changesets list. The release pull request consumes and clears the file for the next release.
