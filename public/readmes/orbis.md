# Orbis

English | [简体中文](./README.zh.md)

Orbis is a remote control client for Deepseek Harness (DSH).

The Orbis plugin provides device pairing, end-to-end encrypted transport, and real-time
updates across multiple devices.

## Getting Started

1. Download the Orbis app. It is currently in beta. [iOS: Join TesFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3Nqcbpns). Android: Working in progress.
2. Install the Orbis plugin into DSH.

```sh
npx @deepseek-ai/dsh plugin --profile web add @orbisapp/remote-dsh@latest
```

3. Configure the plugin and pair your device from the DSH web plugin page (Settings - Plugins - Orbis tab).

## Development

Install dependencies at the repository root, then use a single command to build the plugin,
install it into your local DSH Web profile, and start the test page:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run serve:dsh
```

The page is served at `http://127.0.0.1:3080` by default. Pass flags to change the port or
point at a specific test directory:

```sh
pnpm run serve:dsh --port 3090
pnpm run serve:dsh --workspace-root /path/to/workspace
pnpm run serve:dsh --help
```

## Testing

```sh
pnpm run check:core   # typecheck + tests for everything that builds from this repository alone
pnpm run check:dsh    # typechecks and tests the plugin and client entry points against the public DSH SDK
```

CI runs `check:core` on every push and every pull request, and again before a release.
`check:dsh` uses the public `@deepseek-ai/*` SDK packages installed by the workspace.

## Releasing

Releases are driven by [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Ship every
user-visible change with a changeset and commit it alongside the change:

```sh
pnpm changeset
```

The five workspace packages form one fixed version group, because `@orbisapp/remote-dsh` inlines the
other four at build time. A changeset for any of them versions and releases all five together.
Only `@orbisapp/remote-dsh` is published to npm; the rest are private and are versioned only.

Every push to `main` runs the tests and then opens or updates a **Version packages** pull request
that applies the pending changesets and writes the changelogs. Merging that pull request builds the
bundle and publishes `@orbisapp/remote-dsh` to npm.

To release by hand from a clean checkout of `main`:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run version:packages   # apply changesets, then commit the result
pnpm run release            # build the bundle and publish to npm
```
